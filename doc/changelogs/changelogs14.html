<div class="contents">

The properties of arbitrary lists of atoms, bonds, texts (previously selected with Select dialogs) can now be easly specified with the Modify dialogs (pressing the List button). In the next releases, this will be extended to the other objects. Replaced deprecated macros GTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE, GTK_WIDGET_SENSITIVE by gtk_widget_get_visible, gtk_widget_is_sensitive calls. Replaced direct addressing widget->window, widget->allocation by gtk_widget_get_window and gtk_widget_get_allocation calls (GAMGI needs now GTK 2.18 to compile). Removed a buffer overflow that crashed GAMGI when building crystals of the space group 230.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lists of texts (previously created with Text->Select) can now be
easily modified (for any property recognized by Gamgi) with Text->Modify.</li>
<li>Lists of bonds (previously created with Bond->Select)
can now be easily modified with Bond->Modify.</li>
<li>Lists of atoms can now be easily modified with Atom->Modify!
For efficiency reasons, dialog data is first imported to a cache,
from where atoms or lists of atoms are modified.</li>
<li> GTK 3.0: replaced widget->window direct addressing
by gtk_widget_get_window calls (since GTK 2.14).</li>
<li>GTK 3.0: replaced deprecated macros GTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE by 
gtk_widget_get_visible calls (since GTK 2.18).</li>
<li>GTK 3.0: Replaced deprecated macros GTK_WIDGET_SENSITIVE by

<div class="contents">

This is a bug-fix release. Fixed a GL context bug when multiple windows were open, that could produce no rendering. Fixed memory leaks in handling fonts. Fixed how messages were produced when DejaVu fonts were not found, that could crash GAMGI. Updated old documentation, and the Help system, that could crash GAMGI. Fixed the way mouse dragging is handled that could stop mouse dragging. Corrected ionic radius for S and Sb. Prepared a new, experimental, release that does not require the GTKGLExt library (for X Window System only).

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Found and removed a bug in gamgi_chem_property.c: the ionic
radius for S and Sb were wrong. Checked all ionic radius.</li>
<li>Improved www.gamgi.org front page.</li>
<li>Truetype fonts are now checked in the same way in Text->Create, Text->Modify
and importing from file, in a slightly more robust way than before. Error messages
are handled in a much better way. Fixed a bug in Text->Modify resulting in text
object names not being properly updated.</li>
<li>Found and removed a memory leak in gamgi_mesa_text_font_increase:
when an error occurs, remove font glyph array created before.</li>
<li>Found and removed a memory leak in gamgi_gtk_text_create and
gamgi_gtk_atom_modify: contents is allocated and must be freed.</li>
<li>Found and removed a nasty bug, introduced some time ago in the
code handling the mouse, in gamgi_mesa_area_notify.c, that in many
cases could stop the mouse from dragging.</li>
<li>Updated www.gamgi.org/interfaces/, some documentation was old.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug introduced when moving to DejaVu fonts:
for some fonts the filename had more chars than those expected
in the error string message, resulting in crashs when those fonts
were not found.</li>
<li>Updated documentation for installation: in some systems
(Ubuntu 9.10 for example) the environment variables must be
set in ~/.profile, instead of ~/.bashrc.</li>
<li>Updated gamgi_gtk_help_current.c and gamgi_gtk_help_topic.c:
code for atom copy files was too old, resulting in crashes
when calling documentation for Atom->Copy.</li>
<li>Updated and fixed typos on doc/tutorials: for example the method
<b>Independent</b> in Cell->Link is now called <b>Crystal</b>.</li>
<li>The new code that does not require GTKGLExt is working fine with GAMGI
on Fedora 8 (Gtk 2.12.8), including creating and removing multiple contexts
on the fly, and sharing pre-compiled OpenGL lists.</li>
<li>Wrote a GTK/OpenGL program that seems to work without GTKGLExt!
Tested so far on Fedora 8 (Gtk 2.12.8) and Ubuntu 9.10 (Gtk 2.18.3).
It requires only glx.h (distributed with Mesa) and gdkx.h (distributed
with GTK). We need to test this much more, namely with shared lists,
removing and adding GLcontexts, etc., but if we managed to succeed,
it could be really good news for users and maintainers!</li>
<li>Added initialization tests for GTK, GTKGLExt and OpenGL.</li>
<li>Rewrote gamgi_mesa_area_create: gamgi->glconfig and gamgi->glcontext
are no longer needed.</li>
<li>Added "et al." in Gamgi->About dialog.</li>
<li>Found and fixed a nasty, old bug, introduced when moving from GtkGLArea
to GtkGLExt: when a top window was removed, Open GL lists previously
created no longer worked in new windows. Solution: instead of using
the GL context of the window that was created in first place, just use
the GL context of the window that is currently the first one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Add plane area and direction length to Plane->Measure and
Direction->Measure.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>

dynamic frame with moving ants and dragging anchors,
to select multiple objects and images from the screen.</li>

Improved Object->Select dialogs. All Object->Remove dialogs can now handle
lists of objects with the same functionality as for single objects (this is
the first application of the selection lists that we have been implementing
since Gamgi 0.14). Cell->Link now supports shifts in translations and rotations
for each node, in Crystal mode (this is very useful, to change the lattice origin
and for people doing research on Defects in Crystals). Adapted the ruler code for

<li>Found and removed a bug in Cell->Modify: the cell origin was not
correctly reset to zero, resulting in wrong center coordinates for cell.</li>
<li>Changed the way Wyckoff positions are handled: they should be in the
range ]-1, +1[ when rotation shift is applied (not in [0, +1[ as before).</li>
<li>Implemented Rotation Shift in Cell->Link (in Method Crystal).</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in Scale tool button (added when converting to
Gtk 3.0): passed button instead of label, resulting in wrong behaviour.</li>
<li>Gtk 3.0: replaced ruler->position direct access by
calls to gtk_ruler_get_range and gtk_ruler_set_range.</li>
<li>Implemented Translation Shift in Cell->Link (in Method Crystal).</li>
<li>Improved significantly the layout for dialogs Translation Shift,
Rotation Shift and Cell->Link, resulting from the new Shift functionality.
</li>
<li>Wrote most of the code to handle Translation and Rotation Shifts,
when building Crystals in Cell->Link. This is important for researchers
working in Defects in Crystals.</li>

Implemented a simple and powerful method to select any class of visual objects inside an arbitrary rectangle on any window. Improved the behaviour of Object->Select dialogs. Implemented the new dialogs Window->Select and Assembly->Select.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Removed two visual bugs in Method comboboxes in all Objet->Select
dialogs: submenus now have no titles and have all the same size.</li>
<li>Selection inside a mouse defined rectangle is now working fine also
in Text->Select (recursive), Bond->Select, Assembly->Select (recursive)
and Cell->Select.</li>
<li>The new Assembly->Select dialog is fully working.</li>
<li>Changed atom Type by atom Label, in Atom->Create, Atom->Modify,
Atom->Config and XML files (attribute "type" was replaced by "label").
Changed Element by Type in notebook tags, and Name by Element in
notebook pages. Updated documentation accordingly.</li>
<li>The new Window->Select dialog is fully working.</li>
<li>Completed the code to grab objects inside mouse defined rectangles.
And it seems to be working fine! Needs much more testing though.

<li>We have a good method to add Atoms to Cells with translations
and rotations relatively to their normal positions. This is important
for people doing research in Defects in Crystals.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in expat export code for window:
either export both x,y or none. The same for width,height.</li>
<li>Improved gamgi_mesa_grab.c, to select objects by region.</li>
<li>gamgi->box[4,5] are useless: use window->begin_x, window->begin_y
instead.</li>

The new Atom->Select is now fully working for all methods, except
selecting objects by region. The infrastructure to handle global
lists of objects is in place. Replaced Vera by DeJaVu Truetype
fonts.  Updated documentation, fixed bugs.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Updated Help->Current, Help->Topic and doc/interfaces
for File->Import, File->Export, Atom->Select documentation.</li>
<li>Updated technical links in www.gamgi.org.</li>
<li>Wrote documentation for new dialogs: File->Import, File->Export,
Atom->Select.</li>
<li>New objects can now be added to List Current in Atom->Select.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug related with new gamgi_global_selection
code: on exit, selection lists were removed too late.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in new gamgi_gtk_atom_select.c:
the list Before was not always removed.</li>
<li>Removed directory io/fonts, as the 12 DejaVu fonts are too
large to be distributed with GAMGI. They come with every Linux
distribution and can be easily obtaned from dejavu-fonts.org or
www.gamgi.org, ftp.gamgi.org.</li>
<li>Updated the INSTALL file coming with GAMGI distribution,
regarding Vera to DejaVu font changes.</li>
<li>Updated documentation for Extruded fonts: 12 DejaVu fonts instead of 10
Vera fonts, plus two new labels, "serif_italic" and "serif_bold_italic".</li>
<li>Replaced default path for TrueType fonts, in GAMGI_IO_PATH_TRUETYPE,
from "/usr/X11/lib/X11/fonts/truetype/" to "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/".</li>
<li>DejaVu Truetype fonts used to build 3D extruded fonts are no longer
distributed with Gamgi, due to space reasons. Although these files come
with most Linux distributions, they are also available from www.gamgi.org
and ftp.gamgi.org, as a convinience.</li>
<li>Replaced BitStream Vera by DejaVu TrueType fonts for 3D Solid 
(extruded) fonts. DejaVu fonts are derived from Vera, so visual
differences are minimal and the license is based on the previous one.</li>
<li>Improved the model used to flag which atoms are selected: this
works now also with lists of recursive objects, such as texts, groups,
which would crash before when objects removed recursively appeared
later in the selected list.</li>
<li>Atom->Select, our prototype for Object->Select dialogs, is now
robust, simple, elegant and definitely ready for general usage.
Three methods for object selection have been implemented so far:
1) property ranges (16 properties implemented for Atom objects),
2) GTK list clicking and 3) OpenGL representation clicking.
We expect to add futurely a very useful fourth method: selecting
objects inside a rectangle indicated with the mouse in a OpenGL
graphic area.</li>
<li>More tests on Atom->Select: fixed a logical bug in static_press.</li>
<li>Cleaned gamgi_gtk_atom_select.c, replaced signal "unmap" by 
"destroy" to free Before list, actually removed node list Before.</li>
<li>Implemented and tested the third selection method in Atom->Select:
press Ctrl and click on the OpenGL visual representation of an atom
with the mouse, if this atom is in the Current list it gets
automatically selected on the GtkTreeView.</li>
<li>All *_press global functions receive now the pointer to
GdkEventButton that fully describes the button press.</li>
<li>How to get Ctrl-Click events is now clear, thanks
to Emmanuel Rodriguez from gtk-app-devel-list.</li>
<li>Replaced scale limits 0.0, DBL_MAX by GAMGI_MESA_SCALE_LOWER,
GAMGI_MESA_SCALE_UPPER in all Object->Create and Object->Modify
dialogs, plus all Expat import object functions.</li>
<li>All the selection-by-property functions in Atom->Select are now implemented.</li>
<li>Simplified selection-by-property functions in Atom->Select.</li>
<li>Atom->Select now has selection methods for Mass, Radius,
Charge, Temperature and Occupancy.</li>
<li>The GTK functions to select object rows from code are
working! This is very important because we need this to
select objects directly from the OpenGL graphic area.</li>
<li>Wrote functions gamgi_engine_slist_invert and gamgi_engine_dlist_invert,
to invert slist and dlist lists.</li>
<li>Improved gamgi_gtk_atom_select.c code: the Pick code is much simpler
and faster, the Undo list is removed everytime Atom->Select is unmaped,
all lists of atoms are now properly ordered, in a elegant way.</li>
<li>Object selection by mouse clicking directly on the Treeview is working.</li>
<li>Added a (hidden) object column to treeviews listing objects,
this is needed to speedup object selection from the treeview.</li>
<li>Improved and tested Atom->Select: this is now ready for general usage.</li>
<li>Added -lgdkglext-x11-1.0 to make_rules, as GAMGI failed to build with the 
new linker binutils-gold, already used in some Unix systems. Many thanks to 
Peter Fritzsche, from Debian, who found and fixed the problem.</li>
<li>The new Atom->Select dialog is already working: list of atoms 
can be selected, according to property criteria choosen by users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Add plane area and direction length to Plane->Measure and

This is mainly a bug-fix release: replaced two deprecated castings
preventing GAMGI from compiling in newer systems, simplified the visual
layout for all the 161 notebook pages in task dialogs, fixed several
glitches and bugs related with GTK interfaces, wrote the interface for 
the new Atom->Select dialog. Compiles on Ubuntu 9.10 (x86) without warnings,
at the -O3 -Wall -ansi -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED level.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Improved parsing and security in gamgi_gtk_file_chooser.</li>
<li>Added some lateral padding into all GAMGI GtkTextView widgets:
it looks better.</li>
<li>GAMGI is now compiling without warnings on brand new Ubuntu 9.10
(Gtk 2.18.3), with options: -O3 -Wall -ansi -DG*_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.</li>
<li>Removed several warnings due to non used return values, in functions
write, system, getcwd. GAMGI is now compiling without warnings (Gtk 2.16)
on Ubuntu 9.04, with options: -g -O3 -Wall -ansi -DG_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
-DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED -DGDK_PIXBUF_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
-DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.</li>
<li>All Text dialogs in GAMGI have now the same contour width.</li>
<li>Removed frames and cleaned Cell dialogs.</li>
<li>Removed frames and cleaned Plane, Direction dialogs.</li>
<li>Removed frames and cleaned all Measure dialogs.</li>
<li>Replaced N by Zn in ZNS Blenda data files distributed with GAMGI.</li>
<li>Removed frames and cleaned Assembly, Molecule, Cluster dialogs.</li>
<li>Removed frames and cleaned Layer, Bond dialogs.</li>
<li>Wrote the new GTK layout for Atom->Select dialog. This is another
step in the way to implement real selection of objects in GAMGI.</li>
<li>Removed frames and cleaned all Link, Copy, Remove dialogs.</li>
<li>Removed Xterm and Console buttons from the Tools bar:
this functionaliy can easily be called from outside GAMGI
and is difficult to get right, because it deppends 
of the WM and of personnal preferences.</li>
<li>Removed frames and cleaned Window, Text, Light dialogs.</li>
<li>Replaced deprecated GtkSignalFunc by G_CALLBACK() on gamgi_gtk_select.c.
In new systems, with GTK 2.18.3, GAMGI fails to compile because of this.
Thanks to Daniel Leidert (from Debian) and Pedro Isidoro, who directed
my attention to this!</li>
<li>Removed frames and cleaned Gamgi, Help, Atom dialogs.</li>
