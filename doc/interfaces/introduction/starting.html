To launch GAMGI, just type <b>gamgi</b> on a shell window and press <b>Return</b>. 

<p/>

GAMGI can also be launched with an unlimited number of command line parameters, 
each one naming a GAMGI XML file, for example, <b>gamgi file1.xml file2.xml</b>. 
These files are automatically imported, in the order they were typed 
(<b>file1.xml</b> first, then <b>file2.xml</b>, etc.), exactly as if the files 
had been imported in the same sequence, one by one, after launching GAMGI,
using <b>File Import</b>.

<p/>

This is particularly useful to configure GAMGI automatically, immediately after 
it starts, by reading configuration information from a file. For example, adding 
the line <b>alias gamgi='gamgi $HOME/gamgi/defaults.xml'</b> to the file 
<b>$HOME/.bashrc</b>, prompts GAMGI to read <b>$HOME/gamgi/defaults.xml</b> 
everytime it starts, providing a simple, flexible way to initialize GAMGI with the 
user preferences indicated in <b>defaults.xml</b>. Launching GAMGI by typing 
<b>gamgi data.xml</b> will result in: 1) GAMGI starts; 2) GAMGI imports 
<b>$HOME/gamgi/defaults.xml</b>; 3) GAMGI imports <b>data.xml</b>.

<p/>

GAMGI supports HTTP 1.0/1.1 and anonymous FTP (PASV) protocols (the most recent), 
so file.xml can be a local file, as <b>/home/user/local_file.xml</b> or 
<b>../directory/local_file.xml</b>, or a remote file, such as 
<b>http://website/remote_file.xml</b> or <b>ftp://ftp_server/pub/remote_file.xml</b>.

<p/>

When an error is found in a file, GAMGI shows a message describing the 
problem and ignores the file. The downstream files (not red yet), are
also ignored.
