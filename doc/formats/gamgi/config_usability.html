<h3>sound</h3>

To disable/enable the internal computer sound, used in GAMGI,
for example, to signal that an object has been recognized.  

<pre>
Example: <b>&lt;gamgi sound="yes"/></b> (defined in <b>GAMGI_GTK_BEEP</b>) (default)
Allowed values: <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b> (optional)
</pre>

<h3>tolerance</h3>

When selecting objects with the mouse, the sampled area is 
defined by the pixel where the user clicked the mouse, plus a
<b>tolerance</b> given by the number of neighbour shells that 
should be considered. Thus a tolerance of <b>0</b> means that 
only the chosen pixel should be considered, while a tolerance 
of <b>1</b> means that the 8 pixels around should also be taken 
into account.

<p/>

Small tolerances demand precision when pointing to the object,
but large tolerances make it too easy to select more than one
object, in which case GAMGI considers the object selection as
unsucessfull.

<pre>
Example: <b>&lt;gamgi tolerance="3"/></b> (default)
(defined in <b>GAMGI_MESA_PICK_TOLERANCE</b>)
Allowed values: <b>0</b> - <b>5</b> (defined in <b>GAMGI_MESA_PICK_TOLERANCE_MAX</b>) (optional)
</pre>

<h3>button1, button2, button3</h3>

GAMGI expects to work with a 3-button mouse, where <b>button1</b> handles
operations such as rotating and menu selection, <b>button2</b> handles
operations such as moving and object selection, and <b>button3</b>
handles operations such as scaling. By default, these logical buttons
point to the physical buttons left (1), middle (2) and right (3),
respectively, but this can be changed, by pointing <b>button1</b>, 
<b>button2</b>, <b>button3</b> to different combinations of values
<b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, prodiving 6 possible sequences.

<p/>

This should be usefull for left-hand users and when handling 
a 2-button mouse, to link the most important tasks to the two buttons 
available.

<pre>
Example: <b>&lt;gamgi button1="1" button2="2" button3="3"/></b>) (default)
Allowed values: <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> (optional, coupled)
</pre>
