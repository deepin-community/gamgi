Change here the color components for a single light or a list of lights.

<p/>

To modify a light, click over the graphic area to open a menu and choose a light,
or write its identification (name and number) on the <b>Light</b> entry. To modify
a list of lights, press the button <b>List</b> (after creating the list of lights 
with <b>Light->Select</b>). Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices
remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change a light name write the new name in the <b>Light</b> entry,
followed by the light number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the light).
To change the name for a list of lights, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Ambient</h3>

These <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> entries change the ambient color
of the new light. This can vary between black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and 
white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). 

<p/>

This component emulates light scattered so many times, that it does
not depend of the radiation direction, or the materials surface.

Wired objects cannot reflect diffuse or specular light, so they need 
some ambient light to be visible.

<h3>Diffuse</h3>

These <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> entries change the diffuse color
of the new light. This can vary between black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and 
white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). 

<p/>

This component emulates light equally reflected in all
directions (as the light reflected by a hammered glass).

Solid objects need some diffuse light to show its tridimensional 
shape.

<h3>Specular</h3>

These <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> entries change the specular color
of the new light. This can vary between black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and 
white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). 

<p/>

This component emulates light reflected mainly along
specific directions (as the light reflected by a metal).

Solid objects need some specular light to show brightness effects.
