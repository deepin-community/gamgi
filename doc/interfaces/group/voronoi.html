The Voronoi tesselation produces a polygonal representation,
plus a report of topological and geometrical properties.
For each atom there is a Voronoi polyhedron.

<p/>

Throughout the report, <b>Minimum</b> is the minimum value,
<b>Maximum</b> is the maximum value, <b>Average</b> is the 
mean value and <b>Deviation</b> is the standard deviation,
in the universe formed by all the polyhedrons available.

<h3>Polyhedrons</h3>

Total number of polyhedrons. Polyhedrons with outer faces are considered 
<b>External</b>, all the others are <b>Internal</b>.

<h3>Faces</h3>

Total number of faces. Outer faces are considered <b>External</b>,
all the others are <b>Internal</b>.

<h3>Edges</h3>

Total number of edges. Edges in outer faces are considered <b>External</b>,
all the others are <b>Internal</b>.

<h3>Vertices</h3>

Total number of vertices. Vertices in outer faces are considered <b>External</b>,
all the others are <b>Internal</b>.

<h3>Polyhedron Faces</h3>

Number of faces per polyhedron. The minimum value is 4 (tetrahedron).

<h3>Polyhedron Edges</h3>

Number of edges per polyhedron. The minimum value is 6 (tetrahedron).

<h3>Polyhedron Vertices</h3>

Number of vertices per polyhedron. The minimum value is 4 (tetrahedron).

<h3>Face Vertices</h3>

Number of vertices per face. The minimum value is 3 (triangle).

<h3>Edge polyhedrons</h3>

Number of polyhedrons sharing an edge. The minimum value is 1.
(system edge).

<h3>Edge faces</h3>

Number of faces sharing an edge. The minimum value is 2.
(system edge).

<h3>Vertex Polyhedrons</h3>

Number of polyhedrons sharing a vertex. The minimum value is 1
(system corner).

<h3>Vertex Faces</h3>

Number of faces sharing a vertex. The minimum value is 3
(system corner).

<h3>Vertex Edges</h3>

Number of edges sharing a vertex. The minimum value is 3
(system corner).

<h3>System Volume</h3>

Volume of the global system (including polyhedrons non-selected
for analysis), obtained by: 1) limiting the volume with six outer
planes (the <b>Real</b> value); 2) summing the volumes of all 
the polyhedrons (the <b>Calculated</b> value).

<p/>

Comparing the two values provides a quantitative assertion of the
global geometrical accuracy achieved with the Voronoi tesselation.

<h3>Polyhedron Volumes</h3>

The volume for each polyhedron, obtained by summing the volumes of all its triangular
piramids.

<h3>Polyhedron Areas</h3>

The area for each polyhedron, obtained by summing the areas of all its faces.

<h3>Polyhedron Lengths</h3>

The length for each polyhedron, obtained by summing the lengths of all its edges.

<h3>System Anisotropy</h3>

For each polyhedron face, determine the following matrix, 
where <b>n</b> is the unit vector normal to the face:

<pre><b>
q11 = n(1) * n(1) - 1/3
q12 = n(1) * n(2)
q13 = n(1) * n(3)
q21 = n(2) * n(1)
q22 = n(2) * n(2) - 1/3
q23 = n(2) * n(3)
q31 = n(3) * n(1)
q32 = n(3) * n(2)
q33 = n(3) * n(3) - 1/3
</b></pre>

Then scale the matrix <b>q</b> by <b>A/V**2/3</b>, where <b>A</b>
is the face area and <b>V</b> is the polyhedron volume. Finally
sum for all polyhedron faces. The <b>q</b> matrix thus obtained
describes the polyhedron matrix anisotropy.
 
<p/>

To obtain the <b>System Anisotropy</b>, sum these matrices for 
all polyhedrons, multiplied by the corresponding polyhedron volume 
fractions. The trace of the resulting matrix must be zero.

<p/>

The <b>System Anisotropy</b> is independent of the orientation
of the system.
  
<h3>Polyhedron Anisotropy</h3>

To obtain a scalar <b>Polyhedron Anisotropy</b>, the following equation
is applied:

<pre><b>
q = sqrt { [q11**2 + q12**2 + q13**2 + q21**2 +
q22**2 + q23**2 + q31**2 + q32**2 + q33**2] / 9 }
</b></pre>

For symmetrical solids such as the tetrahedron, the octahedron,
the cube, the dodecahedron, or even the Kelvin 8+6 polyhedron, 
the scalar <b>Polyhedron Anisotropy</b> is always zero.

<p/>

The scalar <b>Polyhedron Anisotropy</b> is independent 
of the orientation of the polyhedron.

<h3>Polyhedron Aberration</h3>

The ratio between the area of a polyhedron and the
area of a sphere with the same volume. As a sphere
is the 3D object with a smaller area/volume ratio,
<b>Spherical Aberration</b> is always above 1.0.

<h3>Face Areas</h3>

The area for each face, obtained by summing the areas of all its triangles.
Faces with an area smaller than a given tolerance (the <b>Area</b> tolerance
in the <b>Group->Measure</b> dialog) are removed.

<h3>Face Lengths</h3>

The perimeter for each face, obtained by summing the lengths of all its edges.

<h3>Face Angles</h3>

The angle between adjacent faces (between 0 and 180 degrees).

<h3>Face Aberration</h3>

The ratio between the perimeter of a face and the
perimeter of a circumpherence with the same area. As
a circumpherence is the 2D object with a smaller perimeter/area
ratio, <b>Circular Aberration</b> is always above 1.0.

<h3>Edge Lengths</h3>

The length for each edge. Edges with a length smaller than a given tolerance
(the <b>Vertex</b> tolerance in the <b>Group->Measure</b> dialog) are removed.

<h3>Edge Angles</h3>

The angle between adjacent edges (between 0 and 180 degrees).

<h3>Seed Lengths</h3>

The distance between atom seeds. The minimum distance must be larger
than a given tolerance (<b>GAMGI_MATH_TOLERANCE_LENGTH</b>, currently 1.0E-4), 
otherwise an error is flagged and the tesselation is canceled.
