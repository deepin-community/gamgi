This dialog lists all the systems that are compatible
with the current settings in the entries <b>System</b>,
<b>Lattice</b> and <b>Group</b>. When the settings are
impossible, no systems are shown. When the entries
are empty, all 6 systems are shown. 

<p/>

For each possible system, GAMGI lists its usual lower-case 
symbol, the common designation, the lattices available and 
the range of space groups where it occurs.

<p/>

GAMGI uses the less common anorthic name to designate the 
triclinic system (as the International Tables for Crystallography 
do), to use a different letter (a) from the tetragonal system (t).
GAMGI groups Hexagonal, Trigonal, Rombohedral in a single
Hexagonal system (thus corresponding to the 6 crystallographic
families of the International Tables for Crystallography).

<p/>

Clicking on a listed option in the lattice dialog, has
exactly the same effect as writing it directly on the
<b>System</b> entry.
