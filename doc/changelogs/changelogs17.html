<div>GAMGI 0.17.5</div><div>25th February 2022</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

This is mostly a cleaning release. Fixed all the strncpy, sprintf, calloc issues
raised by gcc 10.2.1 (included with Debian 11) warnings. Cleaned parts of the
x3d exporting code, involving texts and orbitals. Reviewed, updated the entire
Help->Current and Help->Topic subsystems.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Replaced standard lib function strncpy by gamgi_io_token_cut in
gamgi_gtk_file_chooser to avoid improperly terminated truncated strings.</li>
<li>Replaced calloc by malloc (plus initialization) in gamgi_chem_symmetry.c,
in all calls involving multiple objects, to avoid (false positive) gcc 10.2.1
warnings.</li>
<li>Eliminated a gcc 10.2.1 sprintf -Wformat-overflow= warning in gamgi_io_error.c.
Although the code was safe, gcc was right that it could be improved.</li>
<li>Eliminated a false positive gcc 10.2.1 sprintf -Wformat-overflow= warning in
gamgi_expat_export_config.c.</li>
<li>Eliminated a gcc 10.2.1 warning in gamgi_io_x3d_render due to a potential
sprintf overflow. All gcc 10.2.1 warnings related with strncpy, sprintf and calloc
calls are now fixed.</li>
<li>In io/gamgi_io_x3d code, fixed a sintax issue in the NavigationInfo node,
to avoid a warning with X3D viewer view3dscene.</li>
<li>Started yet another round of cleaning X3D code in io/gamgi_io_x3d.c and
io/gamgi_io_x3d_render.c. Exported text and orbital objects (solid and wired),
are rendering well in X3D viewer view3dscene.</li>
<li>Fixed the set of incompatibility tests in expat/gamgi_expat_import_object.c
for cell objects, which stopped GAMGI from reading stereographic projection files.</li>
<li>Fixed HTML files and Help->Current code for Text->Link, Orbital->Select, Atom->Config,
Molecule->Create, Light->Config and Cell->Config help pages.</li>
<li>Added a test in gamgi_gtk_help_dialog_import to control mistakes in the help page
provided for example in gamgi_gtk_help_current, that could even crash GAMGI when using
a external browser to serve help pages.</li>
<li>Updated, synced information in Help pages for Group, Molecule, Cluster, Cell
objects about Geometry measurements.</li>
<li>Merged, updated Help->Current documentation for Cell->Measure.</li>
<li>Fixed Help->Topic->Interfaces for Orbital->Select, Atom->Config, Molecule->Create,
Cell->Measure, Light->Config, Cell->Config. Fixed Help->Topic->Formats for Light->Config.</li>
<li>Added documentation for File, Gamgi keywords, available from Help->Topic->Interfaces
and Help->Topic->Formats.</li>
<li>Added Help->Current support for second level dialog reports for Cell->Measure Geometry
and Voronoi methods (similar to Cluster->Measure, Molecule->Measure, Group->Measure).</li>
<li>Improved the Atom->Config GTK dialog (Color and View page).</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Write documentation about lists of objects.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
</ul>

<div>GAMGI 0.17.3</div><div>15th July 2017</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Implemented the GTL Cell->Config dialog and the corresponding XML code,
allowing users to set personnal default parameters for Cell objects,
and more importantly, to set different thicknnesses for Cell axes,
borders and nodes, which is very usefull particularly when using
large screen resolutions.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Updated Help->Config files for Light and Atom objects.</li>
<li>Synced gamgi-g and gamgi-x trees.</li>
<li>Updated gamgi_expat_import_object: importing Cell object data
to XML files with the new config rules should be working fine.</li>
<li>Updated gamgi_expat_export_object: exporting Cell object data
to XML files with the new config rules is now working fine.</li>
<li>In Cell->Create and Cell->Modify, Origin vectors and Axes vectors
are now updated automatically for default (Conventional or Primitive)
options when Model changes.</li>
<li>Replaced cell->borders = FALSE by cell->borders = GAMGI_PHYS_NONE,
in engine, gtk, expat and mesa code.</li>
<li>Updated gamgi_expat_export_config: exporting Cell
config data to XML files is now working fine</li>
<li>Updated gamgi_expat_import_config: importing Cell
config data from XML files is now working fine</li>
<li>Improved the Cell->Config dialog, to handle also
default values for Model, Borders, Faces and Nodes.</li>
<li>Redesigned Object->Config dialogs: Config data is now separated in
default data (in the pages with the same names as in Object->Create dialogs)
and global data (applying to all objects, old and new), in the Global (last)
notebook page. Dialogs affected: Atom->Config, Cell->Config, Light->Config.</li>
<li>Implemented Cell->Config dialog and infra-structure. The size of Cell
border lines, node points, and vector axes can now be set globally for all
cells in GAMGI, a feature badly needed. Default values for
cell color and axes usage have been set also.</li>
<li>Fixed a issue in gamgi_gtk_bond_create: the color set in static_init
ignored previous config data.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in gamgi_mesa_draw_pick and gamgi_mesa_draw_grab: Cell rendering
point width was set to line width instead of point width.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Write documentation about lists of objects.</li>

<div>GAMGI 0.17.1</div><div>7th March 2014</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Reviewed all Formats documentation, particularly for Cluster, Group,
Plane, Direction objects. Replaced attribute type by reference in XML
group elements. Reviewed the code bridging GTK and OpenGL. Changed
license for GAMGI source code and GAMGI documentation for GPL v3.

that replaces the GTKGLExt library by our own GLX-based code.
Javier Cabezas ported this code to GTK 3 and is working fine!
Back ported changes so the differences between the code for
GTK 2 and GTK 3 are absolutely minimal.</li>
<li>We cannot use r,g,b colors because of a,b,c cell axes.</li>
<li>Improved Axes layout in Orbital->Create and Orbital->Modify dialogs.</li>
<li>Changed label Model to Scope in Orbital->Create and
Orbital->Modify and changed Help interface accordingly.</li>
<li>Checked all Help Formats documentation pages.</li>
<li>Updated Help documentation for Cluster Formats.</li>
<li>cluster->paints arrays are no longer zero-terminated.</li>
<li>Synced gamgi and gamgi_exp branches.</li>

<li>Updated Help documentation for Plane and Direction Formats.</li>
<li>Updated Help documentation for Group Interfaces and Formats.</li>
<li>Renewed the <a href="http://oami.europa.eu/">EU</a>
trademark <b>GAMGI</b> until <b>2024</b>.</li>
<li>Updated the source code and documentation license to 
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL v3</a>.
<li>Started using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">sha256sum</a>
