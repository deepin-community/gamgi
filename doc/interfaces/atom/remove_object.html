<h1>Atom Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">
<ul>
<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove an atom (or list of atoms, previously 
selected with Atom->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the atom and all its contents 
is removed. This is the default. When an atom used to define an 
atomic plane or direction is removed, the plane or direction is 
automatically removed.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the atom is removed but
its contents (orbitals, texts) is saved, linked to the atom parent.
Atom bonds are removed because they cannot live without the atom.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the atom is preserved 
but all its contents (bonds, orbitals, texts) is removed. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Bond</b>, <b>Orbital</b> or <b>Text</b>,
these objects are removed from the atom.

<p/>

When the removed atom was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over an atom in the current layer, its identification
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
To recover the previous state press <b>Undo</b>.
