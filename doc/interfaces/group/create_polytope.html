Selecting <b>Polytope</b> creates a coordination polyhedron around each
central atom, plus a report of topological and geometrical properties.

<p/>

Throughout the report, <b>Minimum</b> is the minimum value,
<b>Maximum</b> is the maximum value, <b>Average</b> is the 
mean value and <b>Deviation</b> is the standard deviation,
in the universe formed by the selected polyhedrons only.

<h3>Polyhedrons</h3>

Total number of polyhedrons. Polyhedrons are always <b>External</b>.

<h3>Faces</h3>

Total number of faces. Faces are always <b>External</b>.

<h3>Edges</h3>

Total number of edges. Edges are always <b>External</b>.

<h3>Vertices</h3>

Total number of vertices. Vertices are always <b>External</b>.

<h3>Polyhedron Faces</h3>

Number of faces per polyhedron. The minimum value is 4 (tetrahedron).

<h3>Polyhedron Edges</h3>

Number of edges per polyhedron. The minimum value is 6 (tetrahedron).

<h3>Polyhedron Vertices</h3>

Number of vertices per polyhedron. The minimum value is 4 (tetrahedron).

<h3>Face Vertices</h3>

Number of vertices per face. The minimum value is 3 (triangle).

<h3>Vertex Faces</h3>

Number of faces sharing a vertex. The minimum value is 3
(system corner).

<h3>Polyhedron Volumes</h3>

The volume for each polyhedron, obtained by summing the volumes of all its triangular
piramids.

<h3>Polyhedron Areas</h3>

The area for each polyhedron, obtained by summing the areas of all its faces.

<h3>Polyhedron Lengths</h3>

The length for each polyhedron, obtained by summing the lengths of all its edges.

<h3>Polyhedron Aberrations</h3>

This is the <b>Spherical Aberration</b>, the ratio between the area of 
a polyhedron and the area of a sphere with the same volume. As a sphere
is the 3D object with a smaller area/volume ratio,
<b>Spherical Aberration</b> is always above 1.0.

<h3>Face Areas</h3>

The area for each face, obtained by summing the areas of all its triangles.
Faces with an area smaller than a given tolerance (the <b>Area</b> tolerance
in the <b>Group->Measure</b> dialog) are removed.

<h3>Face Lengths</h3>

The perimeter for each face, obtained by summing the lengths of all its edges.

<h3>Face Aberrations</h3>

This is the <b>Circular Aberration</b>, the ratio between the perimeter 
of a face and the perimeter of a circumpherence with the same area. As
a circumpherence is the 2D object with a smaller perimeter/area
ratio, <b>Circular Aberration</b> is always above 1.0.

<h3>Edge Lengths</h3>

The length for each edge.

<h3>Face Angles</h3>

The angle between adjacent faces (between 0 and 180 degrees).
