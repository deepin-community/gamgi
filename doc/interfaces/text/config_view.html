Define here the visual style applied by default to new text messages.
These can be rotated, moved and scaled, exactly as a molecule.

<h3>Style</h3>

This menu controls which style is applied by default when creating 
a new text object. GAMGI supports both <b>Wired</b> (stroked) 
and <b>Solid</b> (extruded) 3D fonts. Stroked fonts are faster 
and more suited for analysis. Extruded fonts are made from 
TrueType faces and are designed for presentations.

<h3>Wired</h3>

This menu sets which stroked font is applied by default when 
creating a new wired text object. Currently there are 14 stroked 
fonts available in GAMGI, including scripting and mathematical fonts.
These fonts are relatively light, allowing text objects to change
in real time.

<h3>Solid</h3>

This menu sets which extruded font is applied by default when creating
a new solid text object. Currently there are 10 extruded fonts available
in GAMGI. These fonts allow text objects to be illuminated, exactly as any 
other solid object.
