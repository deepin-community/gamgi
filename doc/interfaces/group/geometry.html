This report describes, for the selected structure, all
the possible sequences for bond lengths, angles and torsions,
presenting the results in increasing order of the atom elements. 
Geometric relations between non bonded atoms are ignored.

<p/>

For each sequence it is reported the number of occurrences,
the minimum and maximum values, the average value and the
standard deviation (unless no valid occurrences were found).

<h3>Bond Length</h3>

The distance between Atom1 and Atom2.

<h3>Bond Angle</h3>

The valence angle between directions Atom2-Atom1 and Atom2-Atom3.
The results are always presented with positive values.

<p/>

When present, undefined bond angles (when at least two atoms 
are coincident) are reported for each angle sequence.

<h3>Bond Torsion</h3>

The torsion angle between two planes, defined by Atom1-Atom2-Atom3
and Atom2-Atom3-Atom4. The results are always presented with positive values.

<p/>

When present, undefined bond torsions (when at least two atoms 
are coincident or three atoms are colinear) are reported for 
each torsion sequence.
