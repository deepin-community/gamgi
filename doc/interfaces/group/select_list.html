<div id="notebook">

<div class="contents">

<b>Group->Select</b> selects a group or a list of groups.

<p/>

To select an group click the mouse over its visual representation:
if GAMGI recognizes the group it becomes the new selected
object, otherwise the mouse action is ignored.

<p/>

When an object is selected, a beep is emitted and the object 
identification is shown in the window status bar, first in a       
highlighted color (to emphasize that the current object has 
changed) and then in the default color (after a few seconds).

<p/>

An group is a recursive object, so it can contain for example another group,
which in turn can contain an atom. Clicking over the atom is ambiguous: which
group is the user trying to select? everytime this ambiguity occurs, a menu
pops up showing the name and number of all the candidate groups, and if
one is selected, it becomes the new selected object.

<p/>

Only groups in the working layer can be selected, even if
groups are visible in other (transparent or translucid) layers.
For each top window, only one selected object is maintained. This
can be Gamgi (everything), Window (the current window), Layer (the current
layer), or a child object of the current layer. To see which
object is currently selected see its identification in the window
statusbar.

<p/>

<b>Group->Select</b> shows a flat list of all groups currently
existent in GAMGI, not necessarily in the same layer or window. 
For each group, a hierarchical tree shows all its child objects.
