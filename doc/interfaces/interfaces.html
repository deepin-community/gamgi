Throughout all interfaces and formats, lengths are in angstrom, angles
in degrees and decimal numbers are represented with dots. Every parameter
that can be defined in an interface can be defined also in a file
and vice-versa.

Or choose the object class on the menu above, with the middle button, before

Solid objects usually require lights with diffuse and specular components to be
properly represented in 3D space, otherwise they look flat. Wired objects do not 
have a 3D representation, so diffuse and specular lights are not reflected, 
becoming poorly visible when using lights, unless a significant ambient component 
is used. Often it is worth to draw solid and wired objects in different 
layers, with and without lights.

<p/>

When a task dialog is open, to learn how it works, just select <b>Help->Current</b>
and another dialog will pop up, explaining the meaning of all the parameters in the 
task dialog.
