Set here the translation vector applied to each new light
copied from a light or list of lights.  Directional lights
have no position, so <b>Shift</b> does not affect them.

<p/>

By default, each copied positional or spot light has
the same position as the original light. This is expected
when copying a light or a list of lights to a different layer.
However, when each new light is in the same layer as the original
light (for a list of lights, the <b>Local</b> option in the
<b>Layer</b> menu), a small shift helps to separate the
lightning effects produced by the new and original lights.

<p/>

All other properties are the same for copied and original
lights (only the identification numbers are different).
