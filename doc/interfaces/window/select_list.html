<b>Window->Select</b> selects a window or a list of windows.

<p/>

To select a window click the mouse anywhere over the screen:
a menu pops up listing the identification of all the top windows.
If a window is selected, it becomes the new selected object.

<p/>

When an object is selected, a beep is emitted and the object 
identification is shown in the window status bar, first in a       
highlighted color (to emphasize that the current object has 
changed) and then in the default color (after a few seconds).

<p/>

For each top window, only one selected object is maintained. This
can be Gamgi (everything), Window (the current window), Layer (the 
current layer), or a child object of the current layer. To see which
object is currently selected see its identification in the window
statusbar.

<p/>

<b>Window->Select</b> shows a flat list of all windows currently
existent in GAMGI. For each window, a hierarchical tree shows all 
its child objects.
