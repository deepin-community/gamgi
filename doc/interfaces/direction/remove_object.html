<h1>Direction Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">
<ul>
<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove a direction (or list of directions, previously         
selected with Direction->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the direction and all 
its contents is removed. This is the default.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the direction is removed but
its contents (atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) is saved, linked to the direction
parent. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the direction is preserved but 
all its contents (atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) is removed. Atomic 
directions are removed because they cannot live without the defining
atoms.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>atom</b>, <b>bond</b>, <b>orbital</b> or 
<b>text</b>, these objects are removed from the direction. When an atom 
used to define an atomic direction is removed, the direction is automatically 
removed.

<p/>

When the removed direction was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over a direction in the current layer, its identification
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
To recover the previous state press <b>Undo</b>.
