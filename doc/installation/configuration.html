<h3>Run GAMGI from any directory</h3>

If GAMGI was compiled from source and the GAMGI root directory is, 
for example, <b>/home/carlos/gamgi</b>, then the full path for the 
executable is <b>/home/carlos/gamgi/gamgi_version/src/gamgi</b>.

<p/>

To make GAMGI run from any directory, we suggest making first 
a soft link from <b>gamgi</b> to <b>gamgi_version</b>, 
in the GAMGI root directory:

<pre><b>
cd /home/carlos/gamgi
ln -s gamgi_version gamgi
</b></pre>

and then a second soft link from <b>/usr/local/bin</b>
to the executable, typing as root:

<pre><b>
cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s /home/carlos/gamgi/gamgi/src/gamgi gamgi
</b></pre>

Because <b>/usr/local/bin</b> is one of the standard directories
where Unix systems search for executables, GAMGI will be found 
when called from any directory on the system.

<p/>

Changing to a new version of GAMGI requires only to change
the local link (in <b>/home/carlos/gamgi</b>), while the global
link (in <b>/usr/local/bin</b>), that needs root permission, 
must be done only the first time GAMGI is installed.
  
<h3>Set the GAMGI_HELP environment variable</h3>

To inform GAMGI where the help documentation files are, set the 
<b>GAMGI_HELP</b> environment variable, pointing to the <b>doc/</b> 
directory, where the documentation starts. This can be done by adding 
a line as this, to the user <b>.bashrc</b> file:

<pre>
<b>GAMGI_HELP=/home/carlos/gamgi/gamgi/doc; export GAMGI_HELP</b>
</pre>

Alternatively, this information can abe given directly in GAMGI,
selecting Help->Config, or in a config block in a GAMGI XML file.

<h3>Set the GAMGI_TEXT environment variable</h3>

To inform GAMGI where are the Truetype font files,
set the <b>GAMGI_TEXT</b> environment variable, pointing
to the directory with the files. This can be done by adding
a line as this, to the user <b>.bashrc</b> file:

<pre>
<b>GAMGI_TEXT=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype/; export GAMGI_TEXT</b>
</pre>

GAMGI comes with all the needed font files, in the directory
<b>$GAMGI/gamgi_version/src/io/fonts/</b>, in case they
are not available in the system.

<h3>Set the BROWSER environment variable</h3>

GAMGI can be configured to automatically launch a browser
pointing to the adequate help web page. To inform GAMGI which 
browser should be launched, set the <b>BROWSER</b> environment
variable, pointing to the browser executable. This can be done
by adding a line as this, to the user <b>.bashrc</b> file:

<pre>
<b>BROWSER=/usr/X11/bin/mozilla; export BROWSER</b>
</pre>

Alternatively, this data can also be given directly in GAMGI,
selecting Help->Config, or in a config block in a GAMGI XML file.

<h3>Install pnmtopng, pnmtojpeg and pnmtotiff</h3>

These tools come with every Linux distribution and are usually installed
by default. GAMGI uses them to export .png, .jpeg and .tiff files.

<h3>Define automatic default settings</h3>

More experienced users, can define their own default settings
in a XML file and load it automatically everytime GAMGI is called.
This can be done, just adding a line as this, to the user <b>.bashrc</b> file:

<pre>
<b>alias gamgi='gamgi my_defaults.xml'</b>
</pre>

This works even if other files are called. For example, calling:

<pre>
<b>gamgi my_objects.xml</b>
</pre>

would be understood as:

<pre>
<b>gamgi my_defaults.xml my_objects.xml</b>
</pre>

and defaults in my_defaults.xml would be already applied to objects
in my_objects.xml.

<h3>Install the man page</h3>

Go to directory <b>doc/man/</b> in GAMGI documentation, compress 
the man page and copy it to the system <b>man1</b> directory, with
the name <b>gamgi.1.gz</b>:

<pre>
<b>cd /home/carlos/gamgi/gamgi/doc/man
gzip page
cp page.gz /usr/share/man/man1/gamgi.1.gz</b>
</pre>

<h3>Get quick access to the files</h3>

For developers, who need to have quick access to the code,
we suggest creating a few alias in <b>.bashrc</b>
to permit easy navigation through the GAMGI directories,
for example:

<pre>
<b>alias sgi='cd /home/carlos/gamgi/gamgi/src'</b>
</pre>

These alias remain the same when a new GAMGI version is installed, 
if the second symlink described above was made.
