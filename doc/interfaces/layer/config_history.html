Define here the maximum number of old states that can be saved for each layer.

<h3>Undo, Save</h3>

Set the maximum number of old states that can be saved in memory,
using the <b>Undo</b> and <b>Save</b> mechanisms. Everytime this 
number is exceeded, the oldest state is discarded forever.

<p/>

For each layer, GAMGI maintains a list of old states saved automatically
when a discontinuous action takes place, that can be recovered with the 
<b>Undo</b> mechanism.

<p/>

A discontinuous action occurs when a user presses <b>Ok</b>, clicks 
over the ruler to rotate, move, scale an object, or in general when 
a clear boundary can be defined between what existed before and after.

<p/>

Continuous actions occur when objects are moved, rotated, scaled,
directly with the mouse, as parameters are changing almost continuously.
If continuous actions were saved with <b>Undo</b>, in a few seconds all
<b>Undo</b> levels would be filled up with almost equal states and old
<b>Undo</b> states would be removed forever, turning the <b>Undo</b>
mechanism much less useful. Moreover, continuous actions would be slow,
because GAMGI would be saving things all the time.

<p/>

The <b>Save</b> mechanism works exactly as the <b>Undo</b> mechanism,
except that it is fully controlled by the user, who decides when a layer
should be saved, while the <b>Undo</b> mechanism works without any user
intervention. With the <b>Save</b> mechanism, users can save any layer
exactly when they wish (in particular after any discontinuous action),
and control when old states are discarded, after exceeding the
number of <b>Save</b> levels.

<p/>

The maximum number of <b>Undo</b> and <b>Save</b> levels does not affect 
performance but the memory required to keep old states, for each layer, 
for each window, can be significant, particularly for <b>Undo</b>, 
where old states are saved automatically. Therefore the maximum 
number of levels should be kept to relatively low values.

<p/>

Although <b>Save</b> and <b>Undo</b> work exactly in the same way and
complement each other, they use totally independent resources.
