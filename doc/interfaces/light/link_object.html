Link a light or a list of lights to other layers.

<p/>

Lights can be linked only to layers.

<p/>

Gamgi expects users to identify first the light or list of lights
and then the layer to link. Clicking the mouse over the graphic area
in the window creates a menu with all the lights in the current layer
(local selection). When one is selected, its identification is transported
to the <b>Light</b> entry. Pressing the <b>List</b> button, the current
list of lights is selected instead.

<p/>

Gamgi is now expecting users to select a layer, clicking the mouse over
the graphic area of any window to create a menu with all the layers in
that window (global selection). When one is selected, its identification
is transported to the <b>Layer</b> entry.

<h3>Method</h3>

Gamgi suppports only one method to link lights: <b>Object</b>.

<p/>

The <b>Object</b> method links a light or a list of lights to a single
layer.

<p/>

When linking a light, the light is unlinked from its current layer
and linked to the new layer. An error is issued when the layer already
owned the light.

<p/>

After the linking operation, Gamgi always puts on top
the window and layer containing the linked objects.

<p/>

When linking a list of lights, all lights in the list
are unlinked and linked to the selected layer.
