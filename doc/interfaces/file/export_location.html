<div class="contents">

Set here the complete address of the file to export.

<h3>Places</h3>

Choose here the directory (folder) to start searching. Initially
the default is the <b>Current</b> working directory. When the
dialog is reopen, <b>Places</b> always show the <b>Last</b> folder.

<h3>Folder</h3>

Single click on a folder name, to select that folder. Click
on <b>..</b> to go to the previous folder. The current folder
is indicated by the <b>Path</b> label below.

<h3>File</h3>

Single click on a file name to transport its name to the <b>File</b>
entry below. The complete filename is formed by the contents
of the <b>Path</b> label plus the <b>File</b> entry. Currently
the full file name must have less than 200 characters and
the actual file name must have less than 50 characters.

<p/>

After pressing <b>Ok</b>, a confirmation dialog is shown if
the selected file already exists, to make it more difficult 
to overwrite a file by accident.

<p/>

Currently GAMGI can export in the following formats: 1) native XML
(extension .xml); 2) xyz (extension .xyz); 3) rasterized color postscript
(extension .ps); 4) png (extension .png); 5) jpeg (extension .jpg or .jpeg);
6) tiff (extension (.tif or .tiff). GAMGI always uses the file
extension to decide the file format, so for example a proper xyz
file with an extension .xml will be parsed as a XML file and
flagged down as an invalid file. When the filename has no
extension, GAMGI assumes it is written in its native XML format.

<p/>

To export to png, jpeg and tiff formats, the following programs
must be installed: <b>pnmtopng</b>, <b>pnmtojpeg</b> and <b>pnmtotiff</b>.

<p/>

GAMGI accepted formats are described in the documentation in
<b>Manuals->Formats</b> and online on <b>Help->Topic->Formats</b>.

<p/>

In XML format, the exported data is always the selected object.
For example, to export the current layer, the current window or
the current program (everything), just press twice the label <b>Layer</b>,
<b>Window</b> or <b>Gamgi</b> respectively, in the top menu, with the
mouse middle button.

<p/>

GAMGI XML format is a vectorial format, so all information is
preserved in the file, including non-default configuration data.
Configuration data is always written in the beginning of the file,
so it is already loaded when the object data is imported (a necessary
step to guarantee that after importing the file the initial state
is fully restored again).
