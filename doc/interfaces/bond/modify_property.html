Change here the order and covalency for a single bond or a list of bonds.

<p/>

To modify a bond, click over its graphic image, or write its id on
the <b>Bond</b> entry. To modify a list of bonds, press the button
<b>List</b> (after creating the list of bonds with <b>Bond->Select</b>).
Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change a bond name write the new name in the <b>Bond</b> entry,
followed by the bond number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the bond).
To change the name for a list of bonds, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Covalency</h3>

Change the bond <b>Covalency</b>, which is a measure of its percentage 
ionic/covalent character. 

<h3>Order</h3>

Change the bond <b>Order</b>, which represents its chemical order. 
Although any positive number is allowed, the usual values are <b>1.0</b> 
(single bond, the default), <b>2.0</b> (double bond), <b>3.0</b> (triple 
bond) and <b>1.5</b> (aromatic or delocalised bond). 

<p/>

Single, double and triple bonds are rendered in <b>Wired</b> mode,
as single, double and triple rasterized lines. In <b>Solid</b> mode,
single bonds are represented by a cylinder (the sigma bond), double 
bonds have two additional curved volumes on each side (the pi bond), 
 and triple bonds have two more curved volumes on each side (the
second pi bond). 

<p/>

Currently, the orientation of the curved volumes in solid secondary 
bonds is arbitrary. Currently, aromatic bonds are handled as normal 
bonds, according to its bond order, so bonds with order equal to 1.5 
are handled as double bonds.
