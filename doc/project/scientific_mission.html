Our goal is to provide a free computer package to construct, view 
and analyse atomic structures, as powerful and simple to use as 
possible.

<p/>

We believe that open societies, where knowledge is shared and 
discussed, promote innovation and justice, freedom and intelligence, 
and ultimately better individuals and stronger economies. From 
Galileu, Descartes and Newton, to Darwin, Faraday and Einstein, 
the development of Science has been always based in the open 
discussion, in the unrestricted exchange of information. Unfortunately, 
recent changes in the trends governing intellectual and industrial 
knowledge have modified considerably this panorama, and knowledge 
is becoming more and more something that can be owned and 
restricted from the general public.

<p/>

We are thus developing GAMGI - General Atomistic Modelling Graphic 
Interface, a computer package that can be inspected, modified, 
distributed and even included in other programs, according to 
the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">
GPL</a> license. Physical Science students can investigate the code 
to study the mathematical, physical and chemical algorithms 
implemented in GAMGI. Computer Science students can study the code 
to learn how to design the architecture, the data infrastructure, 
and the flux of information of a big application, involving very 
different technologies. As the code is free, GAMGI can be installed 
in any computer, can be recompiled when the operating system changes, 
can be copied as many times as wished, can be immediately investigated 
and hopefully corrected when bugs are found. Users should see GAMGI 
as a common project, something that belongs to the whole community, 
to which they are invited to contribute, if they wish so.

<p/>

GAMGI aims to be useful for: 1) the scientific community working 
in Atomistic Modelling, that needs a graphic interface to build 
input data and to view and analyse output data, calculated with 
Ab-Initio and Molecular Mechanics programs; 2) the scientific 
community at large, studying Chemistry, Physics, Materials Science, 
Geology, etc., that needs a graphic interface to view and analyse 
atomic structural information and to prepare images for presentations 
in classes and seminars; 3) teaching chemistry and physics in 
secondary schools and universities, even inviting students to install 
and run GAMGI at home; 4) science promotion, in schools, exhibitions 
and science museums.
