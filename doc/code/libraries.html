A big application as GAMGI, involving a wide range of 
programming technologies, must necessarily rely on libraries.
For the sake of simplicity and freedom, for both users and 
developers, we aim: 1) to ensure that dependencies are kept to a minimum; 
2) to use preferentially libraries that are also written in C; 3) to use 
only free libraries that put no legal restrictions on the applications built 
with them.

<p/>

Currently GAMGI requires the following
libraries: <a href="http://www.gtk.org">Glib/Gtk</a>,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mesa3d">Mesa</a>,
<a href="http://linux.maruhn.com/sec/gtkglarea.html">Gtkglarea</a>,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat">Expat</a>
and <a href="http://www.freetype.org/">Freetype</a>.
 
<h3>Mesa</h3>

To render the graphics, we use Mesa, a 3D graphics library 
that implements the complete OpenGL specification. Although Mesa
is free software, we are not going to use any Mesa-specific
mechanism. Every single Mesa function used in GAMGI conforms
to the OpenGL standard. Therefore, GAMGI can be compiled, 
linked, executed with any implementation of the OpenGL standard.

<p/>

From the legal point of view, users can link Gamgi GPL code
to non-free OpenGL library implementations, to run in-house, 
as long as the library code is not distributed. Even statically 
compiling GAMGI against non-free libraries is legal, as long as 
the resulting binary is used in-house only and is not distributed 
in any way.

<p/>

GAMGI should run with any version of Mesa or OpenGL. In order to follow 
the developments in the OpenGL specification, Mesa has been changing fast, 
resulting in a couple of bugs in Mesa in the last few years.

<p/>

Versions above Mesa 3.0 and below Mesa 4.0.3 have a bug affecting bond 
cylinders with diffuse lights. Versions between Mesa 4.0.3 and Mesa 5.0
have a bug resulting in segmentation faults on exit, for some specific
window open/close sequences. Mesa 5.0.2 has a bug in normals, affecting
wired objects with lights. Mesa 6.0.1 has a bug affecting atom spheres
with diffuse lights. The latest release, Mesa 6.4.2, works fine.

<h3>Gtk</h3>

We use Glib 1.2 and Gtk 1.2 to build all the widgets shown in GAMGI.
Although this is great free software, Gtk development has been forked
and redesigned to build Gtk 2.0, which is more powerful than Gtk 1.2.

<p/>

Unfortunately there are a couple of issues with Gtk 2.0:
1) Apparently Gtk 2.0 is noticeably slower than Gtk 1.2
and GtkTreeView cannot handle large numbers of nodes; 
2) Gtk 2.0 requires a lot of libraries, including libraries
to handle all kinds of international languages (pango and gconv), 
to handle disabilities (atk), to handle image maps (jpeg, png and 
tiff), plus a library just to handle all these dependencies (pkg).
These issues are probably not important for a GNOME desktop 
application, but they are quite relevant for scientific/engineering 
packages. Upgrading to Gtk 2.0 is therefore not a high priority 
for the GAMGI project, at the moment.

<p/>

According to our goal of reducing GAMGI dependencies to a minimum,
we are not going to use any mechanism (such as lists and objects), 
provided by Gtk or any other library, that falls outside the strict
purpose of that library. We aim to prevent locking GAMGI into a specific 
toolkit, designing the code in such a way as to make changing toolkits 
as simple as possible (including changing from Gtk 1.2 to Gtk 2.0). 

<h3>GtkGLArea</h3>

GtkGLArea is essentially a wrapper around the GLX library. OpenGL does
not depend on the operating system, so GLX is a specific library to
handle the connection between the X Window System and OpenGL. GtkGLArea
in turn makes the bridge between the Gtk toolkit and the OpenGL API.
There are two different GtkGLArea libraries, one to link against
Gtk 1.2 and another to link against Gtk 2.0. Only the first one 
works with Gamgi.

<h3>Expat</h3>

Expat is arguably the fastest non-validating XML parser currently
available, used for example in the Mozilla Gecko engine. Its
simplicity and speed are the perfect match to read XML Gamgi files.

<h3>Freetype</h3>

The Freetype 2.0 library is used in GAMGI to build 3D solid fonts from 
Truetype fonts, such as DejaVuSans.ttf. The outline for each needed 
character is obtained from a TrueType file using Freetype, before 
being extruded and rendered by OpenGL. As fonts are sometimes hard 
to find, GAMGI distributes the DejaVu free fonts, initially developed 
for the GNOME project, in the directory <b>src/io/fonts</b>.
