Link an plane or a list of planes to other objects.

<h3>Hierarchy</h3>

Planes can be linked to objects above or below, in the Gamgi hierarchy. 
Pressing the button <b>Below</b> (the default), the class menu 
shows the classes of objects that can be owned by planes: Orbital and Text 
(the default). Pressing the button <b>Above</b>, the same menu shows the 
classes of objects that can own planes: Layer (the default), Assembly, Cell, 
Cluster, Molecule, Group, Plane and Direction.

<p/>

Gamgi expects users to identify first the plane or list of planes
and then the object to link. When the <b>Plane</b> entry is active 
and empty, clicking the mouse over an plane, on the current layer
(local selection), its identification is transported to the <b>Plane</b> 
entry. Pressing the <b>List</b> button, the current list of planes
is selected instead.

<p/>

Gamgi is now expecting users to click on a object of the class 
currently selected in the class menu. This object can be in 
a different layer or even in a different window (global selection). 

<p/>

To select a visible object, just press the mouse over the object,
in its window. To select objects without visual representation, such
as layers and lights, press the mouse over the graphic area in the window,
to create a menu with all the objects of that class in the window,
which can then be selected.

<h3>Method</h3>

Gamgi suppports only one method to link planes: <b>Object</b>.

<p/>

The <b>Object</b> method links a plane or a list of planes to a single
object, <b>Above</b> or <b>Below</b>.

<p/>

When the <b>Hierarchy</b> is <b>Above</b>, the plane is unlinked from 
its current parent and linked to the new object. When the plane is
moved to a different layer, its bonds are automatically removed.
When the <b>Hierarchy</b> is <b>Below</b>, the child object is
unlinked from its current parent and linked to the plane. An error
is issued when the parent already owned the child object.

<p/>

After the linking operation, Gamgi always puts on top
the window and layer containing the linked objects.

<p/>

When linking a list of planes <b>Above</b>, all planes in the list
are unlinked and linked to the parent object. When linking a list
of planes <b>Below</b>, the child object is replicated as many times
as necessary to link each plane in the list to a different replica.
