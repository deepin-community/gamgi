Everything related with lightning in GAMGI is handled by light objects. GAMGI lights implement all the functionality provided by the OpenGL specification. This includes directional, positional and spot lights, ambient, diffuse and specular light components, and axial and radial light attenuations. The maximum number of lights that each layer can own is fixed by the graphics library used with GAMGI. In Mesa this number is currently 8, the minimum required by the OpenGL specification. However, as the number of layers that each window can own is unlimited, the same is true for the total number of lights per image. Lights are the only objects in GAMGI that cannot own other objects.
