GAMGI windows can be navigated using the keyboard: 1) pressing <b>Tab</b> or 
<b>Down</b> moves forward, to the next active widget (entry, menu, button, etc., 
but not label), while pressing <b>Up</b> moves backward to the previous widget. 
Pressing <b>Enter</b> when a button has focus, has the same effect as clicking 
the mouse over the button.

<p/>

Users can enlarge the drawing area to full screen size by pressing <b>Escape</b>. Pressing the same key again restores the initial state.

<p/>

When several GAMGI windows are open simultaneously, users can navigate through 
them by pressing <b>Page Up</b> and <b>Page Down</b>. This is particularly useful 
to navigate through multiple windows in full screen mode, when window manager 
decorations are no longer available.

<p/>

To hide the menus section, for example to increase the space available for drawing, just press the <b>F1</b> key. Pressing the same key again restores the initial state. To hide the tools section, just press the <b>F2</b> key. Pressing the same key again restores the initial state. To hide the status and scripting sections, just press the <b>F3</b> key. Pressing the same key again restores the initial state.

<p/>

Pressing <b>Ctrl C</b> over any GAMGI window or over the launching xterm window works exactly as if <b>Gamgi->Exit</b> had been selected, showing the <b>Gamgi Exit</b> confirmation dialog. Pressing the <b>End</b> key over any GAMGI window has exactly the same effect.
