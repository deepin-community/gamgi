When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the text and all 
its contents is removed. This is the default.

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the text is removed but
its contents (child texts) is saved, linked to the text parent.

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the text is preserved 
but all its contents (child texts) is removed.

When the removed text was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

Clicking the mouse over a text in the current layer, its identification
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
