Change here the visual representation for a single group or a list of groups.

<p/>

To modify a group, click over its graphic image, or write its identification
(name and number) on the <b>Group</b> entry. To modify a list of groups,
press the button <b>List</b> (after creating the list of groups with
<b>Group->Select</b>).  Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b>
choices remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change a group name write the new name in the <b>Group</b> entry,
followed by the group number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the group).
To change the name for a list of groups, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Style</h3>

When the option <b>Solid</b> is choosen, each polyhedron is
represented as a solid volume, that users can see from the 
outside or from the inside.

<p/>

When the option <b>Wired</b> is choosen, only the face contours 
are shown, thus producing a more light representation.

<h3>Color</h3>

The <b>Color</b> button controls whether the polyhedra are represented
with their own, independent color, or inherit it from the default
color for the neighbour element, or, when this is undefined, from the
current color of each central atom (not necessarily the default color
for its element).

<h3>R, G, B</h3>

The <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> entries define the Polyhedron color:
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) is black and (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) is white. It is used 
to draw the lines in wired mode, and the solid faces in solid mode.
In the last case, lines are drawn using the current layer background 
color, to get a good contrast and eliminate the need to define yet 
another color.

<h3>Scale</h3>

When polyhedrons are linked in <b>Independent</b> mode, the <b>Scale</b>
factor can be used to change its size, including its child objects.
Polytope group objects are scaled around its center.

<p/>

When polyhedrons are linked in <b>Automatic</b> mode, only its parent
objects can be scaled (thus changing the size of all its child objects,
including the polyhedron), and the <b>Scale</b> entry is disabled.

<p/>

The visual representation of an object is always scaled by its own scale 
factor multiplied by the scale factor of all its parent objects until layer,
inclusive.
