<h1>Cell Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">
<ul>
<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove a cell (or list of cells, previously         
selected with Cell->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the cell and all 
its contents is removed. This is the default.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the cell is removed but
its contents (clusters, molecules, groups, planes, directions, atoms,
bonds, orbitals, texts) is saved, linked to the cell parent. Crystallographic
planes and directions directly referencing the cell are removed because they 
cannot live without the cell.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the cell is preserved but 
all its contents (clusters, molecules, groups, planes, directions, 
atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) is removed. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>cluster</b>, <b>molecule</b>, <b>group</b>, 
<b>plane</b>, <b>direction</b>, <b>atom</b>, <b>bond</b>, <b>orbital</b>
or <b>text</b>, these objects are removed from the cell. 

<p/>

When the removed cell was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over a cell in the current layer, its identification
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
To recover the previous state press <b>Undo</b>.
