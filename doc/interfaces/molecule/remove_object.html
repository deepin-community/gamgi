<h1>Molecule Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">
<ul>
<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove a molecule (or list of molecules, previously         
selected with Molecule->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the molecule and all 
its contents is removed. This is the default.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the molecule is removed but
its contents (groups, planes, directions, atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) 
is saved, linked to the cell parent. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the cluster is preserved but 
all its contents (groups, planes, directions, atoms, bonds, orbitals, 
texts) is removed. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>group</b>, <b>plane</b>, <b>direction</b>, 
<b>atom</b>, <b>bond</b>, <b>orbital</b> or <b>text</b>, these objects 
are removed from the cluster.

<p/>

When the removed molecule was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over a molecule in the current layer, its identification
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
To recover the previous state press <b>Undo</b>.
