Select here how the calculated Voronoi polyhedra are shown.

<h3>Borders</h3>

Selecting <b>Faces</b>, only the borders defining the external faces
are shown, thus producing a relatively uncluttered volume
representation.

<p/>

Selecting <b>All</b> shows all the borders, including those inside the
volume. This option is disabled when the button <b>Faces</b> is down,
because in solid mode, internal borders cannot be seen from the outside
and make it very difficult to analyze something from the inside.

<h3>Faces</h3>

When the button <b>Faces</b> is down, the tesselation is
represented as a solid volume, that users can see from
the outside or from the inside.

<p/>

When the button <b>Faces</b> is up, the tesselation is
represented as a wired volume.

<h3>Nodes</h3>

When the button <b>Seeds</b> is up, the atom seeds are visible,
otherwise they are hidden.

<h3>Color</h3>

The <b>Color</b> button controls whether the tesselation is represented
with its own, independent color, or inherits the colors of the atom seeds,
for each polyhedron. When the button <b>Faces</b> is up, an independent
color is necessary, because polyhedrons are then represented only by
wired shared edges, which cannot inherit the color from both faces.

<h3>R, G, B</h3>

The <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> entries define the tesselation color:
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) is black and (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) is white.
