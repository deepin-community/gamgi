<div class="contents">

Change here the position and orientation for a single text or a list of texts.

<p/>

To modify a text, click over its graphic image, or write its id on
the <b>Plane</b> entry. To modify a list of texts, press the button
<b>List</b> (after creating the list of texts with <b>Text->Select</b>).
Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change a text name write the new name in the <b>Text</b> entry,
followed by the text number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the text).
To change the name for a list of texts, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Translation</h3>

The origin of a text object, defined as its top left corner,
can be changed using the <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> entries.
The change can be <b>Absolute</b> or <b>Relative</b> (to the 
former origin).

<h3>Rotation</h3>

The orientation of a text object, defined by the Euler angles theta, 
phi, psi, can be changed using the <b>E1</b>, <b>E2</b>, <b>E3</b> entries.
The change can be <b>Absolute</b> or <b>Relative</b> (to the former Euler 
angles). Euler angles are not addictive, so the text must be 
rotated back with the old angles and forward with the new ones.

<p/>

Euler angles in GAMGI are defined as follows: first, the (x, y, z) 
referential is rotated theta degrees (between 0 and 180) around the 
y axis, then the referential is rotated phi degrees (between 0 and 360) 
around the initial z axis, and finally it is rotated psi degrees (between 
0 and 360) around the new z axis, always in the direct, counter-clockwise, 
direction. If the first Euler angle (theta) is zero, the old and new z axis 
coincide, thus (0, 0, 10) and (0, 5, 5) represent the same rotation. 

<p/>

By default text objects are on a plane parallel to the screen, 
corresponding to Euler angles (0, 0, 0). For this orientation,
<b>Wired</b> (stroked) text objects, and <b>Solid</b> (extruded) 
text objects in a layer with an orthographic projection, will
look exactly as normal 2D text messages.
