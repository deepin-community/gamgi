Each top window has a status bar at the bottom, providing information about 
the current working environment.

<p/>

All the text information related with the GAMGI status that needs to be 
reported is shown in the status bar, except errors and warnings, which are reported 
directly on their own dialog windows, and (TODO) GAMGI actions, which will be appended 
to the current log file. In the normal configuration, the statusbar includes 
a status area on the left, a field showing the current object, a field showing 
the current layer, and finally a watch on the right.

<p/>

When the tools ruler is active, the current translation length, rotation angle 
or scaling factor (depending on the selected action) is shown in the status area,
in real time, so users know exactly which value will be applied before clicking
the mouse.

<p/>

When an object is selected, a beep is emitted and the status bar identifies
the object, using the format <b>object_name object_id</b>, thus confirming
the selection of that object. The object identification is initially shown
in red (to highlight that the current object has changed), and after a few
seconds in black (the permanent color).

<p/>

When a layer is selected, a beep is emitted and the status bar identifies 
the layer, using the format <b>object_name object_id</b>, thus confirming 
the selection of that layer. The layer identification is initially shown 
in red (to highlight that the current layer has changed), and after a few 
seconds in black (the permanent color).

<p/>

When a slow task is taking place, that requires the user to wait, a progress bar 
appears after the watch, moving forward and backward, until the task is completed, 
this way giving the user an hint that GAMGI did not stop and is working to finish the 
task. When the time needed for doing a task can be predicted exactly, the progress bar 
becomes a continuous bar that moves forward only, reaching the right end position when 
the task is completed. This method of showing progress is useful for example in 
multi-frame animations of Molecular Dynamics simulations and normal mode vibrations, 
where the number of frames is previously known.
