Change here the position and orientation for a single orbital or a list of orbitals.

<p/>

To modify an orbital, click over its graphic image, or write its id on
the <b>Orbital</b> entry. To modify a list of orbitals, press the button
<b>List</b> (after creating the list of orbitals with <b>Orbital->Select</b>).
Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change an orbital name write the new name in the <b>Orbital</b> entry,
followed by the orbital number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the orbital).
To change the name for a list of orbitals, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Translation</h3>

The origin of an orbital object, defined as its center,
can be set using the <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> entries.

A simpler way to set directly the orbital position is to click on
the screen, at the wished position, after defining all the other
orbital properties: a new orbital object is created at that position.

<h3>Rotation</h3>

The orientation of an orbital object, defined by the Euler angles theta,
phi, psi, can be set using the <b>E1</b>, <b>E2</b>, <b>E3</b> entries.

<p/>

Euler angles in GAMGI are defined as follows: first, the (x, y, z)
referential is rotated theta degrees (between 0 and 180) around the
y axis, then the referential is rotated phi degrees (between 0 and 360)
around the initial z axis, and finally it is rotated psi degrees (between
0 and 360) around the new z axis, always in the direct, counter-clockwise,
direction. If the first Euler angle (theta) is zero, the old and new z axis
coincide, thus (0, 0, 10) and (0, 5, 5) represent the same rotation.

<p/>

By default, the orbital frame first vector is aligned with the x axis
(to the right), the second vector is on the xy (screen) plane and the
third vector has a positive z coordinate (pointing to the user),
corresponding to Euler angles (0, 0, 0).
