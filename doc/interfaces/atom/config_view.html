Set here default visual data that does not depend of the atomic element.

<h3>Style</h3>

The <b>Style</b> menu is to select the default atom visual representation.
Currently supported styles are: 1) a sphere, for <b>Solid</b>; 2) a cross, for
<b>Wired</b>. The sphere gives a hight visual quality, when coupled with lights
and perhaps a perspective projection. A sphere uses considerable screen space
though and is time consuming.

<p/>

The cross uses much less screen space and computing time. Moreover, when atoms
are bonded, crosses are not represented at all, and atoms are identified just
by the ends of the bond lines, decreasing even further computation needs.
However, wired objects do not have a 3D representation, so diffuse and
specular lights are not reflected, becoming poorly visible when using
lights, unless the ambient component is important, about (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).

<h3>Size</h3>

The <b>Size</b> menu is to select the default atom size.
The intrinsic size of an atom is given by:
<pre>Size x (Variancy x Radius + (1 - Variancy) x Min)</pre>
where <b>Radius</b> is the atom radius and <b>Min</b> is the minimum
radius.

<p/>

In <b>Wired</b> mode, all atom crosses have a constant size, given by 
<b>Size</b> x <b>Min</b>, as <b>Variancy</b> is <b>0.0</b>.

<p/>

In <b>Solid</b> mode, <b>Size</b> selects the default size of the atom spheres.
Combining default atom <b>Size</b> and <b>Variancy</b> with default bond <b>Size</b>,
it is possible to obtain a wide range of styles to represent atomic structures.

In <b>Solid</b> mode, the default is to represent atoms as constant
spheres (<b>Variancy</b> = <b>0.0</b> and <b>Size</b> = <b>0.8</b>),
slightly larger than the bonds (<b>Size</b> = <b>0.5</b>). An elegant
style is to represent atoms as constant spheres with the same <b>Size</b>
as bonds (<b>0.5</b>).

To represent compact cristalline structures, atom <b>Size</b>
and <b>Variancy</b> must be <b>1.0</b>, to be consistent with
cell dimensions. This style can also be used to represent molecules,
in order to emphasize the atomic radius and electronic distribution.

<h3>Variancy</h3>

Choose here the default value for <b>Variancy</b>.
In <b>Wired</b> mode, <b>Variancy</b> is always <b>0.0</b>.

<p/>

In <b>Solid</b> mode, by default <b>Variancy</b> is <b>0.0</b> so the atom 
spheres have all the same size. When <b>Variancy</b> is <b>1.0</b> the atom 
spheres are scaled directly by the atom radius.

<h3>Min</h3>

<b>Min</b> fixes the minimum size for crosses and spheres, as defined by
the equation above for <b>Size</b>. By default this is the H covalent radius.
