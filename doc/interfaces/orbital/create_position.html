Set here the position and orientation of an orbital.

<h3>Translation</h3>

The origin of an orbital object, defined as its center,
can be set using the <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> entries.

A simpler way to set directly the orbital position is to click on
the screen, at the wished position, after defining all the other
orbital properties: a new orbital object is created at that position.

<h3>Rotation</h3>

The orientation of an orbital object, defined by the Euler angles theta,
phi, psi, can be set using the <b>E1</b>, <b>E2</b>, <b>E3</b> entries.

<p/>

Euler angles in GAMGI are defined as follows: first, the (x, y, z)
referential is rotated theta degrees (between 0 and 180) around the
y axis, then the referential is rotated phi degrees (between 0 and 360)
around the initial z axis, and finally it is rotated psi degrees (between
0 and 360) around the new z axis, always in the direct, counter-clockwise,
direction. If the first Euler angle (theta) is zero, the old and new z axis
coincide, thus (0, 0, 10) and (0, 5, 5) represent the same rotation.

<p/>

By default, the orbital frame first vector is aligned with the x axis
(to the right), the second vector is on the xy (screen) plane and the
third vector has a positive z coordinate (pointing to the user),
corresponding to Euler angles (0, 0, 0).
