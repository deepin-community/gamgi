Measure properties involving the <b>Length</b> between atoms and other objects.

<h3>Property</h3>

The supported <b>Length</b> properties, the same as for
<b>Atom->Modify</b>, are listed below. Atoms and other objects
may belong to different parents and may be bonded or not.
Only objects in the current layer can be chosen.

<p/>

An easy technique to select the objects is to click the mouse
sucessively over their visual representations, in the sequence
shown in the dialog. After the last needed object is selected,
GAMGI automatically starts the calculation.

<p/><b>2-Atom Distance</b><p/>

The distance between two Atoms.

<p/><b>Atom 2-Atom Distance</b><p/>

The distance between Atom1 and the direction defined by Atom2-Atom3.

<p/><b>Atom 3-Atom Distance</b><p/>

The distance between Atom1 and the plane defined by Atom2-Atom3-Atom4.

<p/><b>Atom Direction Distance</b><p/>

The distance from an Atom to a Direction.

<p/><b>Atom Plane Distance</b><p/>
  
The distance from an Atom to a Plane.

<h3>Value</h3>

After selecting a property, enter the name of the objects and
press <b>Ok</b>. If all objects are recognized, GAMGI does the
calculation and shows the result in the <b>Value</b> entry.

<p/>

When a calculation ends, GAMGI keeps the objects identification.
To start a new calculation, just click the mouse over a new object:
GAMGI automatically cleans the previous data and inserts the new
object identification. When a new property or page is chosen,
previous data is automatically removed.
