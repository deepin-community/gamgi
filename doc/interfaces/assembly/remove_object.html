<h1>Assembly Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">
<ul>
<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove an assembly (or list of assemblies, previously
selected with Assembly->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the assembly and all 
its contents is removed. This is the default.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the assembly is removed but
its contents (child assemblies, graphs, shapes, arrows, cells, clusters, 
molecules, groups, planes, directions, atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) 
is saved, linked to the assembly parent.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the assembly is preserved but 
all its contents (child assemblies, graphs, shapes, arrows, cells, clusters, 
molecules, groups, planes, directions, atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) is 
removed.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>assembly</b>, <b>graph</b>, <b>shape</b>, 
<b>arrow</b>, <b>cell</b>, <b>cluster</b>, <b>molecule</b>, <b>group</b>, 
<b>plane</b>, <b>direction</b>, <b>atom</b>, <b>bond</b>, <b>orbital</b>
or <b>text</b>, these objects are removed from the assembly.

<p/>

When the removed assembly was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over an assembly in the current layer, its identification
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
To recover the previous state press <b>Undo</b>.
