<b>Text->Select</b> selects a text or a list of texts.

<p/>

To select an text click the mouse over its visual representation:
if GAMGI recognizes the text it becomes the new selected object, 
otherwise the mouse action is ignored. 

<p/>

When an object is selected, a beep is emitted and the object 
identification is shown in the window status bar, first in a       
highlighted color (to emphasize that the current object has 
changed) and then in the default color (after a few seconds).

<p/>

When an object is selected, a beep is emitted and the object 
identification is shown in the window status bar, first in a 
highlighted color (to emphasize that the current object has 
changed) and then in the default color (after a few seconds).

<p/>

Only texts in the working layer can be selected, even if
texts are visible in other (transparent or translucid) layers.
For each top window, only one selected object is maintained. This
can be Gamgi (everything), Window (the current window), Layer (the 
current layer), or a child object of the current layer. To see which
object is currently selected see its identification in the window
statusbar.

<p/>

<b>Text->Select</b> shows a flat list of all texts currently
existent in GAMGI, not necessarily in the same layer or window. 
For each text, a hierarchical tree shows all its child objects.
