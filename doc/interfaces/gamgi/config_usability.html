Define here the way users interact with the graphic interface.

<h3>Buttons</h3>

GAMGI expects to work with a 3-button mouse, where button 
<b>1</b> handles operations such as rotating and menu selection, 
button <b>2</b> handles operations such as moving and object 
selection, and button <b>3</b> handles operations such as scaling. 

<p/>

By default, these logical buttons point to the physical buttons 
left (<b>1</b>), middle (<b>2</b>) and right (<b>3</b>), 
respectively, but this can be changed, pointing logical buttons 
to different physical buttons. Two logical buttons cannot
point to the same physical button.

<p/>

This is particularly usefull for left-hand users and when 
handling a 2-button mouse, to link the most important tasks 
to the two buttons available.

<h3>Tolerance</h3>

When selecting objects with the mouse, the sampled area is
defined by the pixel where the user clicked the mouse, plus a
<b>tolerance</b> given by the number of neighbour shells that
should be considered. Thus a tolerance of <b>0</b> means that
only the chosen pixel should be considered, while a tolerance
of <b>1</b> means that the 8 pixels around should also be taken
into account.

<p/>

Small tolerances demand precision when pointing to the object,
but large tolerances make it too easy to select more than one
object, in which case GAMGI considers the object selection 
unsucessfull.

<h3>Sound</h3>

To disable/enable the internal computer sound. This sound
is used for example to signal that an object has been recognized.
However, it might be irritating for other users in the same room.
