Chose the method of analysis: <b>Geometry</b>, <b>Reciprocal</b> or <b>Voronoi</b>.

<h3>Geometry</h3>

This method measures all the bond lengths, angles and torsions in the
structure, reporting for each quantity, the number of occurrences, the
minimum and maximum values, the average value and the standard deviation.
Geometric relations between non bonded atoms are ignored.

<p/>

Undefined bond angles (when at least two atoms are coincident) are reported
for each angle sequence. Undefined bond torsions (when at least two atoms
are coincident or three atoms are colinear) are reported for each torsion
sequence.

<h3>Reciprocal</h3>

This method builds in a new Layer the reciprocal lattice of the Cell
lattice. Optionally, Plane objects (described by cross patterns, as in
stereographic projections) can be added to the reciprocal lattice nodes.
Optionally, the reciprocal lattice of the primitive lattice related
with the Cell lattice can also be constucted.

<h3>Voronoi</h3>

This method determines the Voronoi tesselation of the structure,
shows the resulting polyhedra in a new layer, and reports a large 
list of its most important geometrical and topological properties.

<p/>

This analysis can be made with planar bondaries (to close the 
outside polyhedra) or with full periodic boundary conditions,
with equal weights for all atoms (the usual Voronoi tesselation) 
or with a different weight for each atom (given by its atomic 
radius, the so-called radical tesselation).
