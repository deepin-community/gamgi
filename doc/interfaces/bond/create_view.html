Set here the bond visual representation.

<h3>Style</h3>

The <b>Style</b> option menu controls the bond visual representation: 
with cylinders in <b>Solid</b> mode, with simple lines in <b>Wired</b> 
mode. By default, the <b>Wired</b> mode is used. To change the default 
select <b>Bond->Config</b>.

<p/>

The cylinder gives a high visual quality, when coupled with lights and 
perhaps a perspective projection. A cylinder uses considerable screen 
space though and is time consuming. 

<p/>

Wired objects do not have a 3D representation, so diffuse and 
specular lights are not reflected, becoming poorly invisible when using 
lights, unless the ambient component is important.

<h3>Size</h3>

In <b>Solid</b> mode, this parameter controls the size of the bond
cylinders. Combining bond <b>Size</b> with atom <b>Variancy</b>
and <b>Size</b>, it is possible to obtain a wide range of styles
to represent atomic structures.

<p/>

The default is to represent atoms with a <b>Size</b> (<b>0.8</b>) 
slightly larger than bonds (<b>0.5</b>). To change the default select 
<b>Bond->Config</b>. An elegant style is to represent bonds with the 
same <b>Size</b> as atoms (<b>0.5</b>).

To guarantee that bond cylinders are closed by atom spheres,
bond <b>Size</b> should not be larger than atom <b>Size</b>.

<h3>Color</h3>

The <b>Color</b> button controls whether the bond is represented with 
its own, independent color, or inherits the colors of the parent atoms.
By default colors are inherited. To change the default select 
<b>Bond->Config</b>.

<h3>R, G, B</h3>

Set the bond color, from black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) to white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
when the bond is rendered with its own, independent, color.

<h3>Scale</h3>

Set the bond size, including its child objects. Bond objects are
scaled around the bond line. The visual representation of an object
is always scaled by its own scale factor multiplied by the scale factor
of all its parent objects until layer, inclusive.

<p/>

Line widths in GAMGI are not affected by <b>Scale</b> attributes, so
bonds represented in <b>Wired</b> mode remain unchanged by <b>Scale</b>
(but not its child!).
