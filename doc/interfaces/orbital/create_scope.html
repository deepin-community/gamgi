Set here the numerical representation of an orbital.

<h3>Style</h3>

There are two ways to describe orbitals in GAMGI: as a cloud of random points
describing all the regions of space where the probability density is above
a specified value, the <b>Wired</b> approach; 2) as the outer isosurface
linking points with the specified probability density, the <b>Solid</b>
approach. Please note that in s orbitals, there are several different
isosurfaces with the same probability density, GAMGI shows only the
most external one.

<h3>Density</h3>

Defines the probability density (probability / volume) value used
to accept points in <b>Wired</b> mode (when they are above this
threeshold) or to build points in <b>Solid</b> mode (where they
have exactly this threeshold).

<p/>

The low default value (<b>1E-6)</b>) was chosen to guarantee that
all the inter-node regions are visible with default parameters.
For example, the six inter-node regions of orbital 6s are all
visible with the default parameters.

<h3>Radius</h3>

Defines the sampling volume that is scanned when building an orbital.
In <b>Wired</b> mode, the sampling volume is the sphere with this radius.
In <b>Solid</b> mode, the sampling volume is the cube containing this
sphere.

<p/>

For each orbital, the default radius is obtained calculating first 
the distance for the last maximum of the radial probability density
(the first Bohr radius, for orbital 1s), then adding an offset (to
guarantee a proper sampling region, currently 2.0 Angstrom) and finally
increasing the radius untill the probability density becomes lower
in all directions than the default probability density.

<h3>Sampling</h3>

In <b>Wired</b> mode, random points are generated and tried
untill the number of accepted points equals <b>Sampling</b>.
By default <b>Sampling</b> is <b>50000 x N</b>,
where <b>N</b> is the main quantum number.

<p/>

In <b>Solid</b> mode, a sampling cubic grid is built for
each octant, with <b>Sampling</b> slices on each dimension.
By default <b>Sampling</b> is <b>50</b>.

<h3>Seed</h3>

In <b>Wired</b> mode, sampling points are randomly positioned using
a sequence of (pseudo) random numbers, generated from a <b>Seed</b>
initiator. Using different seeds, different random sequences and
final results will be produced. Using the same seed, the same results
will be obtained.
