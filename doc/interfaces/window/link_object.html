Link a window or a list of windows to layers.

<h3>Object</h3>

Windows can be linked only to <b>Layer</b> objects.

<p/>

Gamgi expects users to identify first a window or list of windows
and then a layer to link. When the <b>Window</b> entry is active 
and empty, pressing the mouse over the graphic area in the current
window (local selection) creates a menu with all the windows in Gamgi, 
which can then be selected. The current window is initially
proposed in the <b>Window</b> entry. Pressing the <b>List</b>
button, the current list of windows is selected instead.

<p/>

Gamgi is now expecting users to click over the graphic area in a 
window (global selection), to create a menu with all the layers in 
that window, which can then be selected, to enter the <b>Layer</b> 
entry.

<p/>

In the link mode <b>Object</b>, the selected layer must be in a different 
window. In the link mode <b>All</b>, the layer can be any layer in the 
selected window or any non-empty layer in another window.

<h3>Method</h3>

Gamgi suppports two methods to link windows: <b>Object</b>
and <b>All</b>.

<p/>

The <b>Object</b> method links a window to a single <b>Layer</b>.
The layer is unlinked from its previous window and linked to the 
new window. The layer history kept by the <b>Undo</b> and <b>Save</b> 
mechanisms is preserved in this operation. An error is issued when 
the selected layer was already in the window.

<p/>

After the linking operation, Gamgi always 
puts on top the selected window and layer.

<p/>

When linking a list of windows, the layer is replicated as many times
as necessary to link each window in the list to a different replica.
The layer history kept by the <b>Undo</b> and <b>Save</b>
mechanisms is not copied to the replicas.

<p/>

The <b>All</b> method moves all the non-empty layers in all the
other windows to the selected window, remove all the other windows
which now have only empty layers, and finally put the selected
layer as current layer. An error is issued when the selected layer 
cannot be found among the layers reunited in the window.

<p/>

When a list of windows is selected, the <b>All</b> method is disabled.
