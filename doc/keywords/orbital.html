Only the low-level engine infra-structure of orbital objects is implemented 
so far. The goal is to describe: 1) simple hydrogen-like orbitals, s, p, d, f, etc., 
and its hybridisations, sp, sp2, sp3, etc.; 2) complex representations of the 
electronic clouds surrounding the nucleus, commonly provided by combinations of 
Gaussian, Slater and plane wave analytic functions; 3) combinations of numerical 
functions usually described by spline line coefficients; 4) pseudo-potentials 
electronic descriptions. The main difficulty with orbitals is to collect the data 
from files with completely different formats, provided by Gaussian, ADF, DSolid, 
Plana, etc. and build a common way to handle all this information. This problem 
must be correlated with the way GAMGI handles input/output data. Orbitals can 
own text objects, so for example the name of the orbital can be attached to it.
