Change here object and crystallographic data for a single direction or a list
of directions.

<p/>

To modify a direction, click over its graphic image, or write its identification
(name and number) on the <b>Direction</b> entry. To modify a list of directions,
press the button <b>List</b> (after creating the list of directions with
<b>Direction->Select</b>). Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices
remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change a direction name write the new name in the <b>Direction</b> entry,
followed by the direction number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the direction).
To change the name for a list of directions, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Reference</h3>

GAMGI can handle crystallographic directions (selecting <b>Cell</b>),
related with a cell containing the relevant crystallographic information,
and atomic directions (selecting <b>Atoms</b>), defined by two non-coincident
atoms.

<p/>

For a single direction, <b>Reference</b> can be <b>Cell</b>,
<b>Atoms</b> or <b>Local</b>. For a list of directions, <b>Reference</b>
must be <b>Local</b>.

<p/>

When <b>Cell</b> or <b>Atoms</b> is selected, the direction is recreated
from scratch (as if using <b>Direction->Create</b>) and its old content is
removed. As this requires local information for each direction, it cannot
be done for a lists of directions. When <b>Local</b> is selected, previous
features and contents are preserved, unless when specifically changed.

<b>Cell</b>

To create crystallographic directions, set <b>Reference</b> to <b>Cell</b>.
GAMGI automatically shows a <b>Cell</b> entry, plus <b>u</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>w</b>
entries to indicate the direction indices, plus a <b>Vectors</b> menu, to select 
the cell vectors to use, <b>Conventional</b> or <b>Primitive</b>. For the sake of 
simplicity, GAMGI does not accept 4-indice notation for planes or directions 
in hexagonal cells.

<p/>

Pressing the mouse over a cell in the current layer, the cell identification
is automatically written in the <b>Cell</b> entry. When a valid cell is found
and its <b>Type</b> is <b>Projection</b>, the default <b>Line</b> page
is automatically replaced by a <b>Projection</b> page.

<p/>

By default, only one family of crystallographic directions is created.
To create a set of families simultaneously, press the button <b>Set</b> (TODO).

<b>Atoms</b>

When <b>Reference</b> is set to <b>Atoms</b>, GAMGI automatically shows
two <b>Atom</b> entries. Pressing the mouse sucessively over two
non-colinear atoms in the current layer, the two entries become occupied
and the direction defined. After pressing <b>Ok</b>, an error is shown 
if the atoms are coincident.
