<h1>Atom Select</h1>

<div id="notebook">

</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

<b>Atom->Select</b> is used for two different things: 1) to set an
atom as the current object (the object that is moved, rotated, scaled
with the mouse); 2) to select a whole list of atoms that can be
subsequently modified or removed using Atom->Modify or Atom->Remove.

<p/>

To set an atom as the current object, click the mouse over its
visual representation. When an atom is recognized, a beep is emitted
and the atom identification is shown in the window status bar, first
in a highlighted color (to emphasize that the current object has
changed) and then in the default color (after a few seconds).

<p/>

Only atoms in the working layer can be chosen as current object,
even if atoms are visible in other (transparent or translucid)
layers. For each top window, only one current object is maintained.
This can be Gamgi (everything), Window (the current window),
Layer (the current layer), or a child object of the current
layer. The identification of the current object is always
visible in the window statusbar.

<p/>

A faster method to set an atom as current object,
without using the Atom->Select dialog, is to click over
<b>Atom</b> on the main menu with the second mouse button,
and then click over the atom visual representation.

<h3>List</h3>

<b>List</b> always shows a flat list of all the atoms available
in the current <b>Scope</b>. For each atom, a hierarchical tree
shows all its child objects.

<h3>Scope</h3>

This sets the initial <b>List</b> of candidate atoms, presented
on the left, from where the atoms will be selected. Five options
are available: <b>Gamgi</b> (atoms in all windows), <b>Window</b>
(atoms in the current window), <b>Layer</b> (atoms ins the current
layer), <b>Before</b> (the previous list of selected atoms) and
<b>Current</b> (the current list of selected atoms).

<p/>

The list <b>Before</b> allows users to undo possible mistakes
and is removed everytime Atom->Select closes. The list
<b>Current</b> is the real thing, the list of atoms that
is saved for further action when Atom->Select is closed.
When list <b>Current</b> is not empty, the <b>Atom</b> label
on the main menu shows a different color, to signal that a
list of atoms has been selected.

<p/>

By default GAMGI always shows the list <b>Current</b>, except when
this list is empty (for example the first time <b>Atom->Select</b>
is called). In this case GAMGI starts with the list <b>Layer</b>.

<p/>

Thus the new list <b>Current</b> is usually prepared selecting
objects from the existing list <b>Current</b>. This gives users a
simple and effective way to prepare complex lists of objects, by
entering successive filtering conditions and pressing <b>Ok</b>
each time. The list <b>Current</b> thus obtained will be shorter
and shorter and will comply with all the conditions entered before.

<p/>

When <b>Scope</b> is not <b>Current</b>, the selected objects that
are not yet members of the list <b>Current</b> are added to the beginning
of that list. Thus the list <b>Current</b> can be reduced by successive
filtering conditions of the <b>Current</b> list or increased by
successive additions from objects in other <b>Scope</b> lists.

<h3>Action</h3>

When <b>Action</b> is set to <b>Include</b> (the default), the next
<b>Current</b> list is formed by the atoms that have been selected
in the visible <b>List</b> on the left, using any available <b>Method</b>.
When <b>Action</b> is set to <b>Exclude</b>, the next <b>Current</b>
list is formed by the atoms that have not been selected in the visible
<b>List</b>.

<h3>Method</h3>

There are many different techniques to indicate which atoms should be
included or excluded to the list Current. The combo box <b>Method</b>
sets which technique should be used: 1) <b>Pick</b>, select one atom
each time, either pressing Ctrl and clicking on the atom visual representation
on a graphic area or pressing Ctrl and clicking directly on the atom tree
row on the <b>List</b>; 2) <b>Region</b>, select all atoms in a rectangle
in a graphic area (TODO); 3) one of the 17 remaining methods, representing
all the available atom properties.

<p/>

In this case, for each property, a range of values should be entered in entries
<b>Min</b> and <b>Max</b>. When the value in <b>Min</b> is larger than the value
in <b>Max</b>, GAMGI swaps the two limits, issues a warning, and completes
the task. When <b>Min</b> is empty, only the <b>Max</b> condition is applied.
When <b>Max</b> is empty, only the <b>Min</b> condition is applied. When both
<b>Min</b> and <b>Max</b> are empty all values are accepted.

<p/>

These properties can be combined to get the desired selection. For example,
to select a set of atoms between (x0, y0, z0) and (x1, y1, z1) just apply
the property <b>X</b> between x0 and X1, then <b>Y</b> between y0 and y1
and <b>Z</b> betweeb z0 and z1.

<p/>

When no conditions are specified, by defaults all atoms are included
or excluded, according to the <b>Action</b> chosen. For example, to 
disable entirely a list of atoms previously selected, just open 
Atom->Select, change <b>Action</b> to <b>Exclude</b> and press <b>Ok</b>:
the color of the <b>Atom</b> label on the main menu changes to the
default color, signaling that no list of atoms exists.
