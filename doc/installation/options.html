To install and run GAMGI, users can choose one of the following options:

<h3>Download and install a statically compiled executable</h3>

Executables compiled in this way include all the required library code,
so they are easy to run, but waste a lot of unshared memory, thus they
are seldom used today. Statically compiled executables are currently
not available for GAMGI.

<h3>Download and install a dynamically compiled executable</h3>

Usually they are provided as rpm or deb packages. Although currently not 
available for GAMGI, it would be excellent to offer packages for the most 
popular Linux distributions, if someone volunteered their expertise and time.

<h3>Download and compile GAMGI from source code</h3>

Download a gamgi-all-version.tar.gz file, with the whole GAMGI distribution.
Compile and install it, after ensuring that the building libraries are 
all installed.

<p/>

This is the real thing. Users will never feel the joy and raw power of free 
software until they make simple modifications on the source code and see the 
results working on the executable they built. It is the whole difference 
between controlling or being controlled by the software!
