<div>GAMGI 0.09</div><div>11th December 2002</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">
  
Enough is enough, here it is, GAMGI 0.09! Improvements from
previous version are mainly in the usability front. Time
to start completely new code!

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Configuration data modified in &lt;gamgi>&lt;gamgi/> blocks
can now be reset further down in other &lt;gamgi>&lt;gamgi/> blocks.
This is quite usefull when users want to temporarily change
default parameters, and then return to the previous values
(without having to specifically set them).</li>
<li>Clarified a long standing visual bug in the wired bond drawing
code. Finding a solution is easy, finding the best solution
is more difficult.</li>
<li>Added minimum width and height parameters in window configuration
(default width and height parameters were already there).</li>
<li>Added a correction factor to make layer transitions from
perspective to orthographic projections and vice-versa as
smooth as possible, which means objects should have
approximately the same size in both projections.</li>
<li>Copied the most recent manual and format documentation,
plus faqs and changelogs, to $GAMGI/doc. In particular, the
full Users Manual is now linked directly to Help->Current
and Help->Tutorial in GAMGI, though it is in HTML and GAMGI
currently handles it as raw text only, so it takes a bit to
find the actual info among the HTML garbage ;-).</li>
<li>Cleaned gamgi_global_main.c and added gamgi_global_main.h
for consistency and documentation purposes.</li>
<li>Updated the screenshots formats, so they can now
be handled by most browsers and operating systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Write the Technical Description, in www.gamgi.org.
with sections Libraries, Style and Architecture.</li>
<li>Write the Cell Link section of the GAMGI users manual,
in www.gamgi.org.</li>
<li>Write the Attributes section of the GML users manual,
in www.gamgi.org.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="board">
<div>GAMGI 0.08.30</div><div>8th December 2002</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Variable rendering attributes are implemented.
A problem solved and a bug removed. More documentation
available from http://www.gamgi.org/.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Solved a problem with the positional code
(involving the Euler angles) in gtk_cell_modify.</li>
<li>Added Fasttrack web page to http://www.gamgi.org/</li>
<li>Added FAQs web pages to http://www.gamgi.org/</li>
<li>Added Coders Bibliography web page to http://www.gamgi.org/</li>
<li>I decided to change the entire website to XHTML 1.0 in the next
couple of months, to take profit of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
and to make it easier to parse these HTML files using XML tools.</li>
<li>Added Formats web pages to http://www.gamgi.org/. These pages
are a first draft of the documentation that we aim to write, describing
the XML native format used in GAMGI to handle both object and 
configuration data.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in the bond_scan code, 
introduced in the previous version.</li>
<li>Added variable width and slices to render atoms
and bonds, this way allowing users to change on the fly the
rendering quality (and speed) when handling atoms and bonds.
Before, this could be done only at compile time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Improve Help availability.</li>
<li>Write the Technical Description, in www.gamgi.org.
with sections Libraries, Style and Architecture.</li>
<li>Write the Cell Link section of the GAMGI users manual,
in www.gamgi.org.</li>
<li>Write the Attributes section of the GML users manual,
in www.gamgi.org.</li>
<li>Clean code, add more comments, in preparation for GAMGI 0.09.</li>
<li>Improve layer usage consistency.</li>
<li>Add defaults to &lt;gamgi>&lt;gamgi/> blocks.</li>
</ul>

<div>GAMGI 0.08.29</div><div>15th November 2002</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Variable atom spheres and bond cylinders are implemented,
so the only thing that needs to be done before stamping
the oficial GAMGI 0.09 version is to improve documentation.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A consistency problem related with rotation and translation
in cell_create and cell_modify was removed.</li>
<li>engine_remove_soft functions were removed and replaced by
engine_link_list functions, allowing much more flexibility
but with the same goal: allow users to link objects to the
parent of the current parent (typically before this is removed).</li>
<li>changed functions names: engine_copy -> engine_copy_out,
engine_copy_hard -> engine_copy, engine_remove ->remove_out
and engine_remove_hard -> engine_remove.</li>
<li>added functions mesa_rotate_out and mesa_translate_out
and solved the consistency problem mentioned above.</li>
<li>Variable atom and bond size is now working and can
be modified importing apropriate XML GAMGI files. This
is fundamental to show compact cristalline structures.</li>
<li>Moved About from the Help to the Gamgi menu.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Improve Help availability.</li>
<li>Write the Technical Description, in www.gamgi.org.

Cell Link for Conventional Hexagonal Cells is
now working fine, so Cell Link is basically done.
GAMGI 0.09 is now very close.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cell Link for Conventional Hexagonal Cells is
now working fine.</li>
<li>The Extended Cutoff mode in Cell Link should
be working fine now for all cells: in this
mode, outside nodes and filtering are both turned off.</li>
<li>We now work with negative object coordinates
in primitive axes (except Wigner-Seitz cells,
where coordinates must be positive), to
avoid round-off error problems.</li>
<li>Conventional volumes for Hexagonal lattices are
working fine again for all FACES and BORDER
options (this was broken in the previous release,
in order to change the cell origin).</li>
<li>A bug was found and corrected in gtk_atom_create.c
and gtk_atom_modify.c. The element testing in
gtk_atom_create.c, gtk_atom_modify.c,
and gtk_bond_create.c is now much cleaner.</li>
<li>An elegant, user-friendly, solution for the question
of variable sphere radius in atoms was devised. We will
take this as a general configuration option, so users can
decide which method to use and can change it anytime they want,
either through the control panel (not implemented yet) or
importing XML GAMGI files (implemented). The only disadvantage
of this solution is that users will not be allowed to choose
this in a atom-by-atom or layer-by-layer basis, the change
is global, for all atoms of the same style. Different styles
(solid versus wired) have independent choices. Anyway, if one
day we decide to do this on a atom-by-atom basis, it will be
easy to change.</li>
<li>Improvements in the Shell tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Implement variable sphere radius.</li>
<li>Write the Technical Description, in www.gamgi.org,
with sections Mission and Libraries.</li>
<li>Prepare FAQs, screenshots, etc.</li>
<li>Write FAQs for: Users and Coders, Introduction and Troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Clean code, add more comments, in preparation for GAMGI 0.09.</li>
<li>Add ftp support to download remote files. </li>

<div>GAMGI 0.08.27</div><div>28th October 2002</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

GAMGI is running fine on Mac OS X. Cell Link
is now working fine for Rhombus, Sphere, and
Conventional Centered Cells. Work in Cell Link
for Conventional Hexagonal Cells is evolving well
and should be solved for next version.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Back to GAMGI! The problem in Cell Link
regarding how to generate the contributions
of the nodes that are outside the cell has
been solved, by creating a second, auxiliary,
cell, that surrounds the real one. This problem
occurred in all Centered Lattices in Conventional
Volumes, in Rhombus and Spheres volumes.</li>
<li>An algorithm to handle Cell Link
for Conventional Hexagonal Cells has been
partly implemented.</li>
<li>The origin of Conventional Hexagonal Cells
was moved from the center to the lower corner,
because that is the right choice: 1) the origin
is the same as in other volumes; 2) the pattern
rules algorithm works in a logical and simple
way with this choice. As a result, the code to
remove loops and lines is temporarly broken.
It will be working again in the next version.</li>
<li>large file names should be handled in a safe
way now. Limits for names in XML documents were increased.</li>
<li>GAMGI is now running on Mac OS X too,
with the X Window System (XFree86),
thanks to the Fink project!</li>
<li>The socket programming code to
fetch a http server is also running
fine on the Mac OS X version.</li>
<li>swaped the order of the app and lib headers,
so the app headers appear first. This is because
the app headers already contain the global
lib headers, which might be needed to the other
local lib headers (the socket code was not
compiling in Mac OS X because of this).</li>
<li>removed a minor ANSI incorrection
in the help tutorial code.</li>
</ul>
	   
<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Work out link functionality for Hexagonal Conventional cell.</li>
<li>Use variable sphere radius.</li>
<li>Write the Technical Description, in www.gamgi.org.
with sections Mission and Libraries.</li>
<li>Prepare FAQs, screenshots, etc.</li>
<li>Write FAQs for: Users and Coders, Introduction and Troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Add ftp support to download remote files.</li>
<li>Clean code, in preparation for GAMGI 0.09.</li>

Help Current, Help Topic, Help Search,
Help Tutorial and Help Remote functionality
is implemented and working fine.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Help Current, Help Topic, Help Search,
Help Tutorial and Help Remote functionality
is implemented and working fine. This first
version works with .txt files. Futurely we
will change to .xml help files, to allow for
more powerfull text formating and presentation.
This shouldn't be much of a change, as GAMGI
data and config files are already .xml files.</li>
<li>Help About has been added.</li>
<li>An Algorithm to add link functionality for
Hexagonal lattices with Conventional cell volumes
has been partly worked out.</li>

Laboratory, conventional and primitive axes can now be
indicated for all the 5 cell volumes allowed in GAMGI.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cells are now centered using only the nodes.
This is faster and should always work well, but
the main reason is stability: this guarantees
that the cell center doesn't change when atoms
and other child objects are added to assymetrical
positions.</li>
<li>Laboratory (plus Conventional and Primitive)
referentials are now supported in Cell Link,
to set the position of the linked object.</li>
<li>gamgi_phys_cell_link was much improved,
and already supports all the 5 cell volumes.
In particular, automatic conversion between
coordinates in different referentials is
working now, for all possible cases.</li>
<li>The PACKED mode needs improvements,
because nodes outside can also contribute
to the cell contents, for all 5 volume
representations. The problem is solved
conceptually but this has not been implemented yet.</li>
<li>Cleaned gamgi_gtk_dialog and added support for beep configuration.</li>
<li>Added support for mouse configuration.</li>
<li>Added support for undo/save number of levels configuration.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="contents">
  
This is the first version where structural cells
can be easily made from atoms. From here to version
0.09 is mostly cleaning code and writing documentation.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Parent objects in GML files, indicated with
id references must now be in the scope determined
by the child container. The algorithm seems to be
consistent in all cases, and makes object hierarchy
flexible enough, without allowing the type of file
anarchy that was previously possible, where objects
could point to parents anywhere, even in different
files, a potentially hazardous and silly situation.</li>
<li>Element names are now searched using a hash table.
The table has 127 positions, thus some are empty, but
in compensation it is guaranteed that each hash list
has no more than 2 element names. This speeds up element
name search for large amounts of data (large files).</li>
<li>atoms can now be linked to cells in any position,
by indicating its coordinates relatively to either
the conventional or primitive vectors. This works for
all cell volumes supported by GAMGI. This is a first
step to general origin and orientation functionality,
which will be done later, when container objects are
better handled. Adding objects in the laboratory
referential will be done later as well.</li>
<li>Atoms whose coordinates fall outside of the chosen
cell volume are filtered out, if users whish so. This
is working for all cell volumes supported by GAMGI
except Wigner-Seitz cells. ;-)</li>
<li>A bug was found and corrected in engine_cell_copy:
conventional and primitive vectors were not copied,
thus the undo mechanism was compromised.</li>
<li>A bug was found and corrected in phys_cell_link:
The node start and end indexes were not correct for
F lattices.</li>
<li>A bug was found and corrected in math_matrix_inverse:
The determinant was multiplying instead of dividing ;-)</li>
<li>Implement algorithm to import bonds automatically,
in GML files, using Element and Voronoi methods, providing
all the functionality currently available from the GUI: postponed.
We should find a better, integrated, solution for non-static,
algorithmic information, as this, probably by using the log files,
where commands, rather than data, are stored.</li>

<li>Write the Technical Description, in www.gamgi.org,

</div>

<div class="contents">

GAMGI is now running on Mac hardware. The rules
and (the code) to import bonds are now more solid
and elegant.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>GAMGI is now running on Mac hardware:
Linux Yellow Dog 2.2 on G4 Titanium 550.</li>
<li>Very serious bugs corrected: 4 dangling pointers
(causing GAMGI to crash on the Mac) found and corrected.</li>
<li>A minor warning on the socket code was also corrected.</li>
<li>A 1-line check was added to prevent GAMGI from
crashing on KDE, where WINDOWID is not defined.</li>
<li>The warning about WINDOWID absence was also removed.</li>
<li>gdk_window_set_decorations was reintroduced to
handle WM decorations in Escape and Page_Up/Page_Down
actions (and then removed again, see below).</li>
<li>gamgi_engine_find_parent is buggy, a better
algorithm is in the way: corrected.</li>
<li>minor sound details on selection corrected.</li>
<li>Expat: the way objects point to parents has
changed when the parent is not explicitly indicated,
allowing a simpler, more solid hierarchy. Among
other advantages, this makes possible to use a
single find routine to check common parents under
a given scope in both import and export XML operations.
In particular this makes completly impossible,
by design, to create bonds between atoms that
are not in the same layer or even window, for
example, which was not tested before and therefore
made possible.</li>
<li>Expat: The algorithm to import bonds is now simpler,
more elegant, and definitely much more solid, because
bonds between atoms out of scope are not tolerated anymore.
Speed should be just slightly slower, nothing really dramatic.
These changes in the inner core of our XML import code are
not systematically tested yet, so a few corrections might
be needed and added in the next few days, when more
systematic checking will take place.</li>
<li>Regarding window manager environments, the situation
on Yellow Dog 2.2 (should be the same on Red Hat 7.2)
is the following:
<ul>
<li>No environment implements a BROWSER variable
anymore. This might be quite reasonable, but in
practise it means that users must now set this variable
to their prefered browser, if they wish to use Help->Remote
in GAMGI.</li>
<li>Enlightenment: fullscreen mode works, even without
set_decorations, WINDOWID is defined, and console
button works.</li>
<li>Window Maker: fullscreen mode works only after
hiding, set_decorations and show again. Without
set_decorations everyting is hidden except the window bar.
WINDOWID is defined and console button works.</li>
<li>twm: fullscreen mode does not work, even after
hiding, set_decorations and show again (the window bar
is not hidden). Without set_decorations everyting is
hidden except the window bar. WINDOWID is defined and
console button works.</li>
<li>Gnome (Sawfish): fullscreen mode does not work, even after
hiding, set_decorations and show again (the window bar is not
hidden). Without set_decorations everyting is hidden except
the window bar. WINDOWID is defined but console button does
not work.</li>
<li>KDE (kwm): fullscreen mode does not work, even after
hiding, set_decorations and show again (the task
bar is not hidden). Without set_decorations everyting
is hidden except the window bar and the task bar.
WINDOWID is not defined so console button does
not work and is now hidden by GAMGI without warning.</li>
<li>Enlightement is currently the WM that best
works with GAMGI, and the only tested so far
where all the GAMGI functionality is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>

Picking local objects is completed and name search
in XML files should be much faster now, for large data
files, thanks to an optimized hash table.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Name search in XML input files now uses a
a hash table, where the size and the multiplier
can be independently controled and optimized.
This is much faster for large input files and
marginally slower for small input files (where
speed is not an issue anyway).</li>
<li>Objects without visual representation
(layers, lights, windows, the whole gamgi),
and all the recursive objects (texts, groups,
clusters and assemblies), can now be selected
and changed in a consistent and simple way
with the mouse, as done before for non-recursive
objects with a visual representation (atoms, bonds,
molecules, cells, etc.).</li>

Work to export and import XML files
with data and config info continues. A free program that
determines all point symmetry groups is working fine here.
This is the first GAMGI release to pass the 80,000 LOC barrier.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Layer, Light and Cell objects can now be properly
exported (but not Bonds yet, though).</li>
<li>A Import Cell parameter bug corrected.</li>
<li>Infrastructure to export configuration added.</li>
<li>Many small changes on gamgi_global* functions, to
allow import config to work correctly, even in a
multithreading environment.</li>
<li>Configurable bond range data added.</li>
<li>Minor work on gamgi.org site.</li>
<li>Last but not the least, a free program called Symmetry,
developed by Dr. Serguei Patchkovskii, is able to determine
all point symmetry groups, using brute force, and is running
fine here, passing the tests supplied for all groups (about 2,000
lines of C code)! Serguei specifically allowed us to integrate
Symmetry on GAMGI (actually another GPL program is already using
Symmetry). Definitely great news!</li>

Added picking for recursive objects, lots of
cleaning, slashed 3 bugs, including the top-dog. :-)

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>picking recursive objects on the screen is now
fully consistent and easy to use, picking always
the child, then going up, and finally using a pop
menu (as in layers and lights).</li>
<li>Removing cluster, assembly and group objects
is now working, even when recursion happens (local
mode only).</li>
<li>Lots of cleaning on gamgi_mesa* functions,
particularly regarding *gtk-*_press functions.</li>
<li>More engine_* and gtk_* cleaning.</li>
<li>The long-time diffuse light bug was eventually
tracked down to a Mesa bug. Workarounds are in place
and soon this will be gone.</li>
<li>A memory corruption bug was found and corrected:
when removing recursive objects as text, group, cluster
and assembly, some list addressing was done incorrectly.</li>
<li>ModelView and Projection Matrixes, used to put atoms
on the 3D space, were obtained in the wrong place, resulting
in wrong positioning when the layer scale was different from
the default value (1.0).</li>

All object parameters handled in GUI mode can now

dialogs are correct again.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>I decided to improve/develop the mechanisms
involving GtkTree and GtkText widgets in GTK 1.2,
instead of waiting for GTK 2.0.</li>
<li>All object parameters that could be defined so
far in GUI mode, can now be defined also in standalone
mode, importing XML files.</li>
<li>New tests, empty and resources, were added to handle
layers in windows and exceeded number of lights.</li>
<li>New gamgi_mesa_start_* functions were added to allow
clean definition of default parameters, particularly
for new window and layer objects, defined from XML files
and also from the GUI.</li>
<li>window_create*, gamgi_bottom_* and gamgi_reset*
functions slightly changed to accomodate the new way
to enter windows, layers and the mesa_start functions
above.</li>
<li>The action enumeration was extended to include
all select dialogs, plus import and export file dialogs.</li>
<li>The object trees in the select dialogs are working
again (the old way to calculate each top tree was
incorrect since the history mechanism was added, 11 months ago).</li>
<li>gamgi_engine_dlist_bond_* functions were
changed to list objects in the right order
(go from last object to first one, to compensate
the stack effect).</li>
<li>New gamgi_engine_dlist_bond_* functions were added to

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/">EXPAT</a>
library was choosen to parse GAMGI XML files. Needless to say, this

SAX-type parser, that powers Mozilla and Perl, among other high-profile
projects. EXPAT was written in C, by James Clark, the main force
pushing the XML technical comitee. EXPAT is widely considered as the
fastest XML parser available so far and is distributed with a MIT
license.  It is simple, fast, free and written in pure C. Exactly
what the doctor said.</li>
