Chose here the group type: <b>Container</b> or <b>Polytope</b>.

<h3>Container</h3>

The primary purpose of a group container is to contain other objects.
When a group container is created, it has no child objects and consequently 
no visual representation. The only way to select an empty group is 
thus to write its identification or to use the mechanisms provided 
by <b>Group->Select</b>.

<p/>

To avoid this problem, when <b>Ok</b> is pressed and the new group is 
created, the dialog <b>Group->Create</b> is automatically replaced by 
<b>Group->Link</b>, with the new group identification already inscribed 
on it. How to link objects to a group is described in the section 
<b>Group Link</b>.

<h3>Polytope</h3>

For an arbitrary cloud of atoms, defined by <b>Central</b> and
<b>Neighbours</b> settings, build a coordination polyhedron defined
by the smallest convex polygonal representation that surrounds all
the atoms. This is often used in Crystallography to build tetrahedra,
octahedra, and other small regular solids, but the method can be used
to build polyhedra for an arbitrary set of atoms, independently of
their position or number.

<p/>

When Gamgi cannot build a 3D polyhedron, automatically tries to build 
a 2D atomic plane, as in <b>Plane->Create</b>. When a 2D plane cannot 
be defined, automatically tries to build a 1D atomic direction, as in
<b>Direction->Create</b>. When a 1D direction cannot be defined, an 
error is shown.

<h3>Central</h3>

Enter here the name and number of the central atom, around which the 
coordination polyhedron will be built. Pressing the mouse over an atom 
in the current layer, the atom identification is automatically written 
in the <b>Central</b> entry.

<p/>

When <b>Local</b> is selected (the default), only one polyhedron is
constructed, around the <b>Central</b> atom. When <b>Global</b> is 
set, Gamgi builds coordination polyhedra around all the atoms in 
the sampling universe with the same element as the <b>Central</b>
atom.
