- COMPILATION -

1) GAMGI requires the following libraries (latest releases suggested):
GtkGLext 1.0, Mesa, Gtk 2.0, Atk-1.0, Pango-1.0, Cairo, Glib-2.0, 
Expat, Freetype 2.0. Both library (.so) and header (.h) files 
must be installed, before compiling GAMGI. Modern Linux distributions
come with all these files, often already installed. Installing
GtkGLext 1.0 forces the installation of all the other libraries 
(except Expat).

2) When the files are not in standard locations, edit src/make_local 
to add your local paths. Some of the most common PC and Mac configurations 
are commented below.

3) To change compile options edit the file "make_rules" (not needed).

4) Type "make" to create and "make clean"
to remove object files and executable.

- INSTALLATION -

5) We suggest creating a root directory "gamgi" the first time and 
then unarchive the tarball inside, this way automatically creating 
a sub-directory "gamgi_version" for each new version. For example,
/opt/gamgi/ or /usr/local/gamgi/ or /home/carlos/gamgi.

We suggest creating two links, one inside the "gamgi" directory:
ln -s gamgi_version gamgi

and another inside the "/usr/local/bin" directory, for example:
ln -s ~/gamgi/gamgi/src/gamgi gamgi

With the second link GAMGI can be seen everywhere, and when 
installing a new version, we need only to change the first link.

6) Set the environment variable "GAMGI_HELP", to let Gamgi know 
where are the local documentation files. For example, add a line 
as this to file ~/.bashrc (or ~/.profile, in some systems):

GAMGI_HELP=~/gamgi/gamgi/doc; export GAMGI_HELP

7) Set the environment variable "GAMGI_TEXT", to indicate where 
are the DeJaVu TrueType fonts used by GAMGI. For example, if these
fonts are in /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu, the usual place
for most Linux distributions, just add this line to file ~/.bashrc
(or ~/.profile, in some systems):

GAMGI_TEXT=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu; export GAMGI_TEXT

If these fonts are not available, just download them from
dejavu.sourceforge.net, www.gamgi.org or ftp.gamgi.org.

8) Set the environment variable "BROWSER", to let GAMGI know 
which browser to launch, in case "Help Remote" is solicited. 
For example, add a line as this to file ~/.bashrc (or ~/.profile,
in some systems):

BROWSER=firefox; export BROWSER

9) Compiling and installing GAMGI is trivial, 
_as_long_as_ all libraries can be seen at compile 
time, link time and run time. If problems arise, 
please see doc/installation/. To contact the author 
send a message to <jcgp07@gmail.com>.

10) To install a man page and an icon, see DISTROS.
