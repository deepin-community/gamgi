<h1>Window Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">
<ul>
<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove a window (or list of windows, previously         
selected with Window->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the window and all 
its layers are removed. This is the default.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the window is preserved 
but all its layers are removed and replaced by a new one. The new
layer becomes the current object and the current layer.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over the graphic area in the current window
creates a menu with all the windows, which can then be selected.
Initially, the identification of the current window is inserted 
in the <b>Window</b> entry. This task cannot be reversed, so 
pressing <b>Ok</b> is required.
