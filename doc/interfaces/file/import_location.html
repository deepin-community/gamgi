<div class="contents">

Set here the complete address of the file to import.

<h3>Places</h3>

Choose here the directory (folder) to start searching 
or the transfer protocol to import the file. Initially
the default is the <b>Current</b> working directory. When the 
dialog is reopen, <b>Places</b> always show the <b>Last</b> folder,
even if the last selected option was <b>HTTP</b> or <b>FTP</b>.

<p/>

When the selected option is <b>HTTP</b> or <b>FTP</b>, the
protocol is copied to the <b>Path</b> label below, and the
full file name should be entered in the  <b>File</b> entry.
For example, selecting <b>HTTP</b> and writing
<b>www.gamgi.org/dat/molecule/silicates/q10.xml</b>
or seleting  <b>FTP</b> and writing
<b>ftp.gamgi.org/gamgi/dat/molecule/silicates/q10.xml</b>
in both cases will import the silica monomer Si(OH)4.

<h3>Folder</h3>

Single click on a folder name, to select that folder. Click
on <b>..</b> to go to the previous folder. The current folder
is indicated by the <b>Path</b> label below.

<h3>File</h3>

Single click on a file name to transport its name to the <b>File</b>
entry below. The complete filename is formed by the contents
of the <b>Path</b> label plus the <b>File</b> entry. Currently
the full file name must have less than 200 characters and
the actual file name must have less than 50 characters.

<p/>

Currently GAMGI can import in the following formats: 1) native XML
(extension .xml); 2) xyz (extension .xyz). GAMGI always uses the file
extension to decide the file format, so for example a proper xyz
file with an extension .xml will be parsed as a XML file and
flagged down as an invalid file. When the filename has no
extension, GAMGI assumes it is written in its native XML format.

<p/>

GAMGI accepted formats are described in the documentation in
<b>Manuals->Formats</b> and online on <b>Help->Topic->Formats</b>.

<p/>

GAMGI XML format is a vectorial format, so all information is
preserved in the file, including non-default configuration data.
Configuration data is always written in the beginning of the file,
so it is already loaded when the object data is imported (a necessary
step to guarantee that after importing the file the initial state
is fully restored again).
