- ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES -

GAMGI requires two environment variables, GAMGI_HELP and GAMGI_TEXT.
GAMGI_HELP should point to the directory doc/, where the Help
documentation files are. GAMGI_TEXT should indicate where are the ten 
Bitstream Vera Truetype fonts, that are also distributed by GAMGI:

VeraBI.ttf  VeraMoBd.ttf  VeraMoIt.ttf  VeraSeBd.ttf  Vera.ttf
VeraBd.ttf  VeraIt.ttf  VeraMoBI.ttf  VeraMono.ttf  VeraSe.ttf

If your distribution does not come with these files, just set GAMGI_TEXT 
to the directory src/io/fonts/. If your distribution already has 
these files, remove src/io/fonts/ and point GAMGI_TEXT to the 
system directory containing them. For example, in Debian:
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera/

The best solution is probably to launch gamgi from a wrapper script, 
as in the following working example, that reads files from the 
command line and automatically sets GAMGI_HELP and GAMGI_TEXT:

#!/bin/sh
GAMGI_HELP=/usr/local/gamgi/doc
export GAMGI_HELP
GAMGI_TEXT=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera
export GAMGI_TEXT
exec /usr/local/bin/gamgi "$@"

To check that these variables are properly set, select
File->Import and choose dat/text/keyboard.xml,
then select Help->Current.

- DATA FILES -
The wrapper script above can be used to read any 
data files from the command line (see the man page).

- MAN PAGES -
The GAMGI man page is at doc/man/, with instructions.

- ICONS -
The GAMGI icons are at doc/icon/.
Currently only rasterized transparent png images are available, 
with 316x316, 128x128, 48x48, 32x32, 22x22, 16x16 pixels. Read
doc/icon/icon.html to see the images and an explanation.

If GAMGI is part of your distribution, we would be delighted
to know about it, just send us a note, to <jcgp07@gmail.com>.
