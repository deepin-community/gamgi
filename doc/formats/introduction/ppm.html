GAMGI uses the file extension to automatically determine the file format. 
To export a standard .ppm file of the whole graphic area of a GAMGI window, 
just give the filename the extension <b>.ppm</b>.
These files start with an header:

<p/>

<pre><b>
P3
#Made with GAMGI 0.12.8
750 402
255
</b></pre>

where the first line indicates the type of file, the second line 
is a comment, the third line is the number of columns (750) and lines (402)
and the fourth line is the maximum color value (255).

<p/>

After the header, the number of lines and columns in the file is the 
same as in the graphic area (from top to bottom), each position describing 
a pixel as a triplet of rgb colors, ranging from <b>0</b> to <b>255</b> 
(the maximum allowed value).

<p/>

This format produces notoriously large files, although very simple,
without loss of information and well supported by most graphics 
applications, such as the GIMP and XV.
