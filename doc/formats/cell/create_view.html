<h3>faces</h3>

Controls the visual representation of the lattice faces. In <b>wired</b> 
mode, the lattice faces are represented by wired lines connecting the 
vertices.  In <b>solid</b> mode, the lattice faces are represented by 
solid polygons, that users can see from the outside or from the inside.

<p/>

When the selected <b>type</b> is <b>rhombus</b> or <b>sphere</b>, 
the cell must be represented in <b>wired</b> mode, otherwise the 
actual lattice would be hidden by the filtering volume. When
<b>type</b> is <b>projection</b>, faces cannot be represented.

The cell object must always have a visual representation, so
at least one of the lattice components, <b>faces</b>, <b>nodes</b>
and <b>borders</b> must be visible.

<pre>
Example: <b>&lt;cell ... faces="no"/></b> (default)
Allowed values: <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b> (optional)
</pre>

<h3>nodes</h3>

Controls whether the lattice nodes are visible or not. When 
<b>type</b> is <b>projection</b>, nodes cannot be represented.

The cell object must always have a visual representation, so
at least one of the lattice components, <b>faces</b>, <b>nodes</b>
and <b>borders</b> must be visible.

<pre>
Example: <b>&lt;cell ... nodes="yes"/></b> (default)
Allowed values: <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b> (optional)
</pre>

<h3>borders</h3>

Controls the visual representation of the cell borders. When <b>borders</b>
is <b>none</b>, no borders are represented in any cell representation. 
When <b>borders</b> is <b>edges</b>, only the outer line contours are shown. 
The boundaries between cells are hidden, as long as they are in the same 
plane, independently of the lattice parameters. When <b>borders</b> is 
<b>faces</b>, all lines are shown, except those inside the volume 
representation, making it easier to see the cell contents. Selecting 
the option <b>all</b>, all border lines become visible, including those 
inside the cell. 

<p/>

The <b>faces</b> and <b>all</b> options are disabled when <b>type</b> is
set to <b>rhombus</b> or <b>sphere</b> filtering modes. The <b>all</b> option 
is disabled when <b>faces</b> is set to <b>yes</b>, because in solid mode the 
inner borders cannot be seen from the outside and make it very difficult to 
analyze something from the inside. When <b>type</b> is <b>projection</b>, the 
borders option is always <b>edges</b>, meaning the projection circumpherence.
  
The cell object must always have a visual representation, so
at least one of the lattice components, <b>faces</b>, <b>nodes</b>
and <b>borders</b> must be visible.

<pre>
Example: <b>&lt;cell ... borders="all"/></b> (default)
Allowed values: <b>all</b>, <b>faces</b>, <b>edges</b>, <b>none</b> (optional)
</pre>

<h3>red, green, blue</h3>

Set the cell color, between black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). 
When the cell is shown in wired mode, this color is used to render the cell 
lattice framework. When the cell is shown in solid mode, faces are rendered 
using this color, and wired boundaries are rendered using the current layer 
background color.

<pre>
Example: <b>&lt;cell ... red="1.0" green="1.0" blue="1.0"/></b> (default)
(defined in <b>GAMGI_MESA_CELL_R</b>, <b>GAMGI_MESA_CELL_G</b>
and <b>GAMGI_MESA_CELL_B</b>)
Allowed values: <b>0.0</b> - <b>1.0</b> (optional, coupled)
</pre>

<h3>scale</h3>

Change the cell size, including its child objects. Cell objects are
scaled around the cell center. The visual representation of an object
is always scaled by its own scale factor multiplied by the scale factor
of all its parent objects until layer, inclusive.

<pre>
Example: <b>&lt;cell ... scale="1.0"/></b> (default)
(defined in <b>GAMGI_MESA_SCALE</b>)
Allowed values: positive real (optional)
