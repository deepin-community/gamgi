<h3>Style</h3>

Gamgi supports <b>Wired</b> stroked fonts and <b>Solid</b>
extruded fonts. Stroked fonts are faster and are more suited for
analysis. Extruded fonts are made from TrueType faces and are 
designed for final presentations.

<p/>

When a new <b>Style</b> is selected, the <b>Face</b> menu is 
automatically updated, showing only the fonts available for 
the new <b>Style</b>. The default font for the new <b>Style</b>
is automatically selected.

<h3>Face</h3>

Currently GAMGI supports 14 stroked fonts:

<pre><b>
1) Roman and Roman Monospace;
2) Sans and Sans Bold;
3) Serif and Serif Bold;
4) Script and Script Bold;
5) Gothic English, Gothic German and Gothic Italian;
6) Symbol Sans, Symbol Serif and Symbol Serif Bold.</b></pre>

<p/>

The first two were made for Sun, used by the X consortium 
and currently distributed with GLUT and freeglut packages.
The 12 other fonts were digitized by Allen V. Hershey, used
by several packages and currently distributed with GNU plotutils.

<p/>

Currently GAMGI supports 12 extruded fonts:

<pre><b>
1) Sans, Sans Bold, Sans Italic and Sans Bold Italic;
2) Serif, Serif Bold, Serif_Italic and Serif Bold Italic;
3) Mono, Mono Bold, Mono Italic and Mono Bold Italic;</b></pre>

<p/>

The typefaces for these 12 fonts were made from DejaVu TrueType
fonts, derived from the Vera fonts made by BitStream for the Gnome project.

<h3>R, G, B</h3>

The <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> entries define the text color,
from black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) to white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).

<h3>Scale</h3>

Set the text size, including its child objects. Text objects are
scaled around the text center. The visual representation of an object
is always scaled by its own scale factor multiplied by the scale factor
of all its parent objects until layer, inclusive.
