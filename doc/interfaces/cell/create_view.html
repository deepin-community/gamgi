Define here the cell visual aspect.

<h3>Faces</h3>

When the button <b>Faces</b> is down, the cell is represented as a 
solid object, that users can see from the outside or from the inside. 
This option is disabled in <b>Projection</b>, <b>Rhombus</b> and 
<b>Sphere</b> volumes (otherwise the filtering volume would hide 
the lattice inside).

<p/>

When the button <b>Faces</b> is up, the cell is represented as a wired 
object, formed by lines connecting the vertices (or by circumpherences, 
in the <b>Sphere</b> representation).

<h3>Nodes</h3>

When the button <b>Nodes</b> is up, the nodes are visible, otherwise 
they are hidden. This option is disabled for <b>Projection</b> volumes.

<h3>Borders</h3>

Selecting <b>None</b>, no borders are shown in any volume representation. 
Selecting <b>Edges</b>, the outer line contours are shown but cell
boundaries are hidden (as long as they are in the same plane, independently 
of the lattice parameters). Selecting <b>Faces</b>, all lines are shown, 
except those inside the volume representation (for <b>Parallelepiped</b> 
and <b>Sphere</b> volumes, <b>Edges</b> and <b>Faces</b> options behave 
in the same way).

<p/>

Selecting <b>All</b> shows all the border lines, including those inside. 
This option is disabled when the button <b>Faces</b> is down, because 
in solid mode, internal borders cannot be seen from the outside and make 
it very difficult to analyze something from the inside. Options <b>Faces</b> 
and <b>All</b> are disabled in <b>Parallelepiped</b> and <b>Sphere</b> 
volumes, as there are no additional lines to represent in these 
representations, only the outer lines already shown with the option
<b>Edges</b>. All options except <b>Edges</b> are disabled for 
<b>Projection</b> volumes.

<p/>

At least one visual element, <b>Nodes</b>, <b>Faces</b> or <b>Borders</b>, 
must be visible when the cell is created, otherwise an error is flagged.

<h3>R, G, B</h3>

The <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> entries define the cell color,
from black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) to white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). It is used 
to draw the lines and nodes, in wired mode, and the solid faces, 
in solid mode. In the last case, lines and nodes are drawn using 
the current layer background color, to get a good contrast and 
eliminate the need to define yet another color.

<h3>Scale</h3>

Set the cell size, including its child objects. Cell objects are
scaled around the cell center. The visual representation of an object
is always scaled by its own scale factor multiplied by the scale factor
of all its parent objects until layer, inclusive.
