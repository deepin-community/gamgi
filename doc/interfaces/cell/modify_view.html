Change here the visual representation for a single cell or a list of cells.

<p/>

To modify an cell, click over its graphic image, or write its identification
(name and number) on the <b>Cell</b> entry. To modify a list of cells, press
the button <b>List</b> (after creating the list of cells with <b>Cell->Select</b>).
Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change an cell name write the new name in the <b>Cell</b> entry,
followed by the cell number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the cell).
To change the name for a list of cells, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Faces</h3>

When the button <b>Faces</b> is down, the cell is represented as a 
solid object, that users can see from the outside or from the inside. 
This option is disabled in <b>Projection</b>, <b>Rhombus</b> and 
<b>Sphere</b> volumes (otherwise the filtering volume would hide 
the lattice inside).

<p/>

When the button <b>Faces</b> is up, the cell is represented as a wired 
object, formed by lines connecting the vertices (or by circumpherences, 
in the <b>Sphere</b> representation).

<h3>Nodes</h3>

When the button <b>Nodes</b> is up, the nodes are visible, otherwise 
they are hidden. This option is disabled for <b>Projection</b> volumes.

<h3>Borders</h3>

Selecting <b>None</b>, no borders are shown in any volume representation. 
Selecting <b>Edges</b>, the outer line contours are shown but cell
boundaries are hidden (as long as they are in the same plane, independently 
of the lattice parameters). Selecting <b>Faces</b>, all lines are shown, 
except those inside the volume representation (for <b>Parallelepiped</b> 
and <b>Sphere</b> volumes, <b>Edges</b> and <b>Faces</b> options behave 
in the same way).

<p/>

Selecting <b>All</b> shows all the border lines, including those inside. 
This option is disabled when the button <b>Faces</b> is down, because 
in solid mode, internal borders cannot be seen from the outside and make 
it very difficult to analyze something from the inside. Options <b>Faces</b> 
and <b>All</b> are disabled in <b>Parallelepiped</b> and <b>Sphere</b> 
volumes, as there are no additional lines to represent in these 
representations, only the outer lines already shown with the option
<b>Edges</b>. All options except <b>Edges</b> are disabled for 
<b>Projection</b> volumes.

<p/>

At least one visual element, <b>Nodes</b>, <b>Faces</b> or <b>Borders</b>, 
must be visible when the cell is created, otherwise an error is flagged.

<h3>r, g, b</h3>

The <b>r</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>b</b> entries define the cell color,
from black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) to white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). It is used 
to draw the lines and nodes, in wired mode, and the solid faces, 
in solid mode. In the last case, lines and nodes are drawn using 
the current layer background color, this way assuring a good 
contrast and eliminating the need to define yet another color.

<h3>Scale</h3>

Change the cell size, including its child objects. Cell objects are
scaled around the cell center. The visual representation of an object
is always scaled by its own scale factor multiplied by the scale factor
of all its parent objects until layer, inclusive.
