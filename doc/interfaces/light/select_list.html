<div class="contents">

<b>Light->Select</b> selects a light or a list of lights.

<p/>

To select a light click the mouse anywhere over the screen:
a menu pops up listing the identification of all the lights.
If a light is selected, it becomes the new selected object.

<p/>

When an object is selected, a beep is emitted and the object 
identification is shown in the window status bar, first in a       
highlighted color (to emphasize that the current object has 
changed) and then in the default color (after a few seconds).

<p/>

Only lights in the working layer can be selected, even if
lights are visible in other (transparent or translucid) layers.
For each top window, only one selected object is maintained. This
can be Gamgi (everything), Window (the current window), Layer (the 
current layer), or a child object of the current layer. To see which
object is currently selected see its identification in the window
statusbar.

<p/>

<b>Light->Select</b> shows a flat list of all lights currently
existent in GAMGI, not necessarily in the same layer or window. 
Lights do not own other objects, so no hierarchical tree is shown.
