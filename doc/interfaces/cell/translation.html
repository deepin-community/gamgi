A position in cell space is given by the coordinates of the
three cell vectors. To convert to absolute space, the cell
rotation, translation and zero node translation must be applied.

A position in reference space is given by the coordinates of the 
three reference vectors. To convert to absolute space, the reference
rotation, translation and zero node translation must be applied.

<p/>

The alignement consists in translating the cell so the
cell and the reference entered positions become the same.

<h3>Cell</h3>

The entries <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>z</b> indicate the coordinates
of the three cell vectors for a given position. These coordinates 
can be given in terms of <b>Conventional</b> or <b>Primitive</b> 
vectors, using the <b>Vectors</b> menu.

<h3>Reference</h3>

The reference can be the current layer (the default) or another 
cell. To select a cell as reference, press <b>Cell</b> and click 
on its visual representation (or write its identification directly 
on the enabled entry).

The entries <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>z</b> indicate the coordinates of 
the three reference vectors for a given position. When the reference 
is a cell, these are the cell vectors. When the reference is the layer, 
these vectors are the layer orthonormed axes.

The reference coordinates can be given in terms of <b>Conventional</b>
or <b>Primitive</b> vectors, using the <b>Vectors</b> menu.
When the reference is the layer, only the option <b>Conventional</b>
is available.

<p/>

Pressing <b>Ok</b> on the second level dialog, the <b>Align</b>
information is saved but the actual translation is calculated only 
after pressing <b>Ok</b> on the first level dialog, to ensure
that changing later some cell parameters will not produce
wrong results.

<p/>

To disable the <b>Align</b> information, open again the 
second level dialog, which now shows the previously 
entered data, and press <b>Cancel</b>.
