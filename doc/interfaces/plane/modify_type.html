Change here object and crystallographic data for a single plane or a list of planes.

<p/>

To modify a plane, click over its graphic image, or write its identification
(name and number) on the <b>Plane</b> entry. To modify a list of planes, press
the button <b>List</b> (after creating the list of planes with <b>Plane->Select</b>).
Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change a plane name write the new name in the <b>Plane</b> entry,
followed by the plane number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the plane).
To change the name for a list of planes, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Reference</h3>

GAMGI can handle crystallographic planes (selecting <b>Cell</b>), related with
a cell containing the relevant crystallographic information, and atomic planes
(selecting <b>Atoms</b>), defined by three non-colinear atoms.

<p/>

For a single plane, <b>Reference</b> can be <b>Cell</b>, <b>Atoms</b>
or <b>Local</b>. For a list of planes, <b>Reference</b> must be <b>Local</b>.

<p/>

When <b>Cell</b> or <b>Atoms</b> is selected, the plane is recreated
from scratch (as if using <b>Plane->Create</b>) and its old content is
removed. As this requires local information for each plane, it cannot
be done for a lists of planes. When <b>Local</b> is selected, previous
features and contents are preserved, unless when specifically changed.

<b>Cell</b>

To create crystallographic planes, set <b>Reference</b> to <b>Cell</b>.
GAMGI automatically shows a <b>Cell</b> entry, <b>h</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>l</b>     
entries to indicate the plane indices, plus a <b>Vectors</b> menu, to select 
the cell vectors to use, <b>Conventional</b> or <b>Primitive</b>. For the sake 
of simplicity, GAMGI does not accept 4-indice notation for planes or directions 
in hexagonal cells.

<p/>

Pressing the mouse over a cell in the current layer, the cell identification
is automatically written in the <b>Cell</b> entry. When a valid cell is found
and its <b>Type</b> is <b>Projection</b>, the default <b>Polygon</b> page                 
is automatically replaced by a <b>Projection</b> page.

<b>Atoms</b>

When <b>Reference</b> is set to <b>Atoms</b>, GAMGI automatically shows
three <b>Atom</b> entries. Pressing the mouse sucessively over three 
non-colinear atoms in the current layer, the three entries become occupied
and the plane defined. After pressing <b>Ok</b>, an error is shown if the 
atoms are disposed linearly.
