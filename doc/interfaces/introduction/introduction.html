The GAMGI philosophy is borrowed from Unix (each module should do one thing only 
and do it well; these modules should interact easily, so their combination can 
provide a enormous range of functionality) and Perl (a program should be designed 
to make the easy jobs easy, without making the hard jobs impossible). Implementing 
these concepts is, of course, much harder than to enunciate them, but a lot of 
thinking has been invested trying to find the best solutions, and we believe 
that with time we will be converging to them.

<p/>

We aim to make the GAMGI interface as powerful and simple as possible. The expert 
should not be slowed down by mechanisms and tools which are useful only for the 
newbie. The novice should not be forced to learn complex concepts and techniques 
to accomplish even the simpler tasks.

<p/>

The GAMGI window interface is divided in 5 distinct sections, from top to bottom: 
Menus, Drawing, Tools, Commands and Status.
