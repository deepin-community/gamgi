<b>Help->Tutorial</b> provides a guide, step by step, to selected tasks.

<p/>

These tutorials show how to accomplish a wide range of actions 
covering most aspects of GAMGI, from simple tasks designed to get 
newbies started as quickly as possible, to more complex ones, showing 
less obvious yet powerfull aspects of GAMGI. The emphasis is not on 
the recipe itself, but on the rationale behind it.

<p/>

For each tutorial, the number of pages and a descriptive title are shown, 
so users can predict the complexity and time needed to complete the task.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over a given tutorial row selects the tutorial. 
Pressing <b>Ok</b> after that opens a new window, describing 
in detail the procedure to follow. When this is too long, the whole 
procedure is divided in various pages and <b>Back</b>, <b>Next</b> 
buttons are provided to navigate back and forward.
