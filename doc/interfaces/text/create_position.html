Define here the text position and orientation.

<h3>Translation</h3>

The origin of a text object, defined as its top left corner,
can be set using the <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> entries.

A simpler way to set directly the text position is to click on 
the screen, at the wished position, after defining all the other 
text properties: a new text object is created at that position.

<h3>Rotation</h3>

The orientation of a text object, defined by the Euler angles theta, 
phi, psi, can be set using the <b>E1</b>, <b>E2</b>, <b>E3</b> entries.

<p/>

Euler angles in GAMGI are defined as follows: first, the (x, y, z) 
referential is rotated theta degrees (between 0 and 180) around the 
y axis, then the referential is rotated phi degrees (between 0 and 360) 
around the initial z axis, and finally it is rotated psi degrees (between 
0 and 360) around the new z axis, always in the direct, counter-clockwise, 
direction. If the first Euler angle (theta) is zero, the old and new z axis 
coincide, thus (0, 0, 10) and (0, 5, 5) represent the same rotation. 

<p/>

By default text objects are on a plane parallel to the screen, 
corresponding to Euler angles (0, 0, 0). For this orientation,
<b>Wired</b> (stroked) text objects, and <b>Solid</b> (extruded) 
text objects in a layer with an orthographic projection, will
look exactly as normal 2D text messages.
