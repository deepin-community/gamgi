<b>Assembly->Create</b> creates a new assembly.

<h3>Assembly</h3>

The <b>Assembly</b> entry provides a name for the assembly object. 
This is optional: when empty (or filled with separator characters, 
as space, tab, newline), the assembly will be named Assembly.
Object identification is explained in <b>Introduction Identification</b>.

<p/>

An assembly is a container whose primary purpose is to contain other objects.
When an assembly is created, it has no child objects and consequently no visual
representation. The only way to select an empty assembly is therefore to write
its identification or to use the mechanisms provided by <b>Assembly Select</b>.

<p/>

To avoid this problem, when <b>Ok</b> is pressed and the new assembly 
is created, the <b>Assembly Create</b> dialog is automatically replaced 
by the <b>Assembly Link</b> dialog, with the new assembly identification 
already inscribed on it. How to link objects to a assembly (TODO) is 
described in the section <b>Assembly Link</b>.
