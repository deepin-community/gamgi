Set here which folders and files should be hidden and shown.

<p/>

Each entry can contain multiple patterns, separated by white spaces or commas,
each one describing a set of files or folders that should be hidden or shown.
The character <b>*</b> is a wild card representing any number of any characters,
and can be used anywhere in a pattern.

<p/>

For example, the sequence <b>*abc def*ghi*</b> contains two patterns, indicating
all occurrences with either: 1) "abc" in the end; or 2) "def" in the beginning,
followed by "ghi" anywhere.

<p/>

First, all occurrences indicated in <b>Hide</b> are removed. From the remaining
occurrences, only those indicated in <b>Show</b> are shown. By default, all
occurrences are shown, so an empty <b>Hide</b> means remove nothing, and
an empty <b>Show</b> means show everything.

<h3>Folders</h3>

By default <b>Hide</b> is set to <b>.*</b>, to hide all dot folders.

<h3>Files</h3>

By default <b>Hide</b> is set to <b>.*</b>, to hide all dot files.
