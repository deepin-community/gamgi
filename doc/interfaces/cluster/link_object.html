Link a cluster or a list of clusters to other objects.

<h3>Hierarchy</h3>

Clusters can be linked to objects above or below, in the Gamgi hierarchy. 
Pressing the button <b>Below</b> (the default), the class menu 
shows the classes of objects that can be owned by clusters. Pressing
the button <b>Above</b>, the same menu shows the classes of objects
that can own clusters.

<p/>

Gamgi expects users to identify first the cluster or list of clusters
and then the object to link. When the <b>Cluster</b> entry is active 
and empty, clicking the mouse over a cluster, on the current layer
(local selection), its identification is transported to the <b>Cluster</b> 
entry. Pressing the <b>List</b> button, the current list of clusters
is selected instead.

<p/>

Gamgi is now expecting users to click on a object of the class 
currently selected in the class menu. This object can be in 
a different layer or window (global selection). 

<p/>

To select a visible object, just press the mouse over the object,
in its window. To select objects without visual representation, such
as layers and lights, press the mouse over the graphic area in the window,
to create a menu with all the objects of that class in the window,
which can then be selected.

<h3>Method</h3>

Gamgi suppports only one method to link clusters: <b>Object</b>.

<p/>

The <b>Object</b> method links a cluster or a list of clusters
to a single object, <b>Above</b> or <b>Below</b>.

<p/>

When linking a cluster and the <b>Hierarchy</b> is <b>Above</b>, the cluster
is unlinked from its current parent and linked to the new object. When the
cluster is moved to a different layer, its bonds are automatically removed.
When the <b>Hierarchy</b> is <b>Below</b>, the child object is unlinked
from its current parent and linked to the cluster. An error
is issued when the parent already owned the child object.

<p/>

When the new child previously owned the new parent (a situation made
possible because clusters can own other clusters), the new parent
is first linked to the new child parent. An error is issued when the
parent already owned the child object.

<p/>

After the linking operation, Gamgi always puts on top
the window and layer containing the linked objects.

<p/>

When linking a list of clusters <b>Above</b>, all clusters in the list
are unlinked and linked to the parent object. When linking a list
of clusters <b>Below</b>, the child object is replicated as many times
as necessary to link each cluster in the list to a different replica.
