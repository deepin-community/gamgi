Set here the translation applied to the child object or list of objects.

<p/>

When linking a orbital to another object, the translation is always
applied to the child object: the orbital itself when linking above,
the other object (orbital) when linking below.

<p/>

The final child position is given by this translation vector added
to the child or parent origin, as defined by the <b>Reference</b> option.
By default this is the child origin and the translation vector is
<b>0.0</b>, <b>0.0</b>, <b>0.0</b>, so no translation is applied.

<p/>

When a list of orbitals is linked above, <b>Reference</b> is set by default
to <b>Child</b>, so orbitals preserve their positions and are not superposed.

<p/>

When a list of orbitals is linked below, each orbital will be linked to a new,
automatically created, child object, and <b>Reference</b> is set by default
to <b>Parent</b>, so childs remain near their parent orbitals and are not superposed.
