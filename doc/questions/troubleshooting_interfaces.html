<h3>1. After importing a file with objects, these are not visible.</h3>

If the region of space that currently can be seen does not contain 
the coordinates of the objects in the file, these will not be visible, 
though everything is fine and working well. Possible solutions are: 
1) scale the layer down, so objects become smaller and a larger region 
of space can be seen at once; 2) if in doubt, use <b>Layer->Select</b> 
to check which objects indeed belong to the current layer; 3) edit the 
file and check whether the object coordinates are compatible with the 
current layer field of visibility. In a default layer, objects have 
coordinates around (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the viewing direction is from 
positive to negative z axis, so objects with negative z coordinates 
will be more easily visible; 4) use <b>Layer->Modify</b> to change 
the layer (projection and position) parameters untill the objects 
become visible.

<h3>2. After modifying a layer, the objects become invisible.</h3>

GAMGI gives users the flexibility to change all aspects related with 
visibility and projection of each layer, which can be bad if users 
do not use this power in a sensible way. Possible solutions are: 
1) scale the layer down, so objects become smaller and a larger 
region of space can be seen at once; 2) if in doubt, use <b>Layer->Select</b>
to check which objects indeed belong to the current Layer;  3) use 
<b>Layer->Modify</b> to change the layer (projection and position) 
parameters untill the objects become visible; 4) use <b>File->Export</b> 
to export the current layer to a file, edit the file and remove the layer, 
and then use <b>File->Import</b> to import the objects to a new, default, 
layer; 5) Use <b>Undo</b> to recover the previous layer conditions;

<h3>3. After selecting a visible object, the object is not found.</h3>

By construction, each layer is completely independent of
the other layers in the same window, even if these are
still visible. Therefore, only objects that are in the
current layer can be selected directly, otherwise they
are not found. This is valid for all objects that a layer
can contain, including lights.

<h3>4. After creating a light, the objects become invisible.</h3>

A wired object does not reflect light, so diffuse and specular 
components cannot iluminate it. When lights are not present, diffuse 
and specular light components are (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) but ambient light 
is (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), so objects can be seen. When a light is created, 
all components are set initially to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and wired objects 
may become invisible, if the ambient light is too small. The solution 
is to increase the ambient light, using <b>Light->Modify</b>.

<h3>5. After creating a light, the lights become invisible.</h3>

Ambient light is additive, so two lights with ambient components 
(0.3, 0.3, 0.3) will be equivalent to a light with ambient component 
(0.6, 0.6, 0.6). When the ambient light is too strong, exceeding the 
limit (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), diffuse and specular components cannot be seen. 
Therefore, ambient light becomes (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) and diffuse and specular 
components become (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), which is exactly the situation when 
no lights are present. The solution is to decrease the ambient light, 
using <b>Light->Modify</b>.

<h3>6. After importing a file with bonded atoms, these are not visible.</h3>

In wired mode, unbonded atoms are represented by crosses.
When bonds are formed between them, the crosses are replaced
by simple lines joining the atoms, changing color at
half-distance. If the atoms are in the same position or very
close, the line cannot be seen and the atoms and bond become
invisible. Clearly this problem only occurs for overlaping
atoms, and the solution is to move them to correct positions.
