<div>GAMGI 0.13</div><div>2nd February 2008</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Grabed data on the most important isotopes (masses, abundances, half-life times) and radius (natural element atom-atom distances, effective and calculated atomic radius, covalent, van der Walls). Grabed data on the widely used Shannon ionic radius (depending on valence, coordination and spin). Although already merged with GAMGI, all this data is not available yet for final users (except covalent radius). Prepared glib_gtk_gtkgl.tar.gz, containg all the old glib, gtk and gtkglarea .h and .so files needed to compile GAMGI on x86, x86_64 and ppc architectures, available from ftp://ftp.gamgi.org/gamgi/src/. Fixed a bug in Plane->Create.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Updated the INSTALL file included with the GAMGI tarball.</li>
<li>Merged the new data and drivers on mass, ionic radius and atomic 
radius with GAMGI.</li>
<li>Wrote and tested the driver to handle the various atomic radius.</li>
<li>Added data describing radius: natural atom-atom distances in elements,
atomic (effective and calculated) and van der Waals radius (currently
GAMGI comes only with covalent radius). Many thanks to Luis Veiros, 
who helped collecting this data. Source: Web_of_Elements.</li>
GAMGI comes only with covalent radius.</li>
<li>Wrote and tested the driver to handle the shannon ionic radius.</li>
<li>Wrote and tested the driver to handle the isotopic data.</li>
<li>Added data describing the well known Shannon ionic radius,
published in Acta Crystallographica in 1976 for most elements, as a 
function of valence, coordination and spin, and widely used today, 
namely in ceramics books. Many thanks to Pedro Isidoro, who sent me
copies of the 1969 and 1976 Shannon papers.</li>
<li>Added data describing the main isotopes for all elements,
including abundances and half-life times. Source: Wikipedia, 
Web_of_Elements, and others.</li>
<li>Prepared a file, glib_gtk_gtkgl.tar.gz, containg all the
glib, gtk and gtkglarea .h and .so files needed to compile
GAMGI on x86, x86_64 and ppc architectures, available from
ftp://ftp.gamgi.org/gamgi/src/.</li>
<li>Found and removed a little bug in Plane->Create: when the 
initial and final order was the same, the order was always 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Redesign Atom->Create and Atom->Modify, according with the new
notebook style, with more properties, including a wide range of atomic
radius.</li>

<div>GAMGI 0.12.12</div><div>3rd December 2007</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Wrote tutorials about Point Symmetry and Voronoi Tesselation and added older 
tutorials to the GAMGI Help mechanism. Redesigned Cell->Measure, which can be 
used now to analyse Geometry, Voronoi Tesselation and Reciprocal Lattice. Improved 
Plane->Create, Plane->Modify, Direction->Create, Direction->Modify, slashing several 
important positioning bugs. Plane->Modify, Direction->Modify and XML files fully work 
now with autonomy All. Removed two bugs gone unnoticed with some gcc versions, resulting 
in a warning and an error, when compiling. If no major problems are found, next release 
will be 0.13.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Changed the default colors for GAMGI text documentation.</li>
<li>Soved a positioning bug in Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify,
when going to atomic planes, directions from objects with a different
position.</li>
<li>Solved a positioning bug in Plane->Create and Direction->Create,
with atomic planes and positions, introduced with last release changes.</li>
<li>Solved a positioning bug in Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify, 
when changing from All to Partial or None Autonomy, introduced with the
Autonomy All new code.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when importing planes, directions with autonomy ALL
from XML files.</li>
<li>Atomic and crystallographic planes and directions can now 
be modified in all cases where old or new Autonomy is All.</li>
<li>Updated the dialog dimensions for Help->Tutorial and Help->Topic.</li>
<li>We are planning to port GAMGI to GTK 2* (or perhaps 3*), as this 
seems to be the most reasonable long-term solution for GAMGI.
Even OLPC, a notoriously unbloated project, is using GTK2 these days.
(with Python).</li>
<li>Added a two-page tutorial on Voronoi tesselation.</li>
<li>Added a two-page tutorial on Point Symmetry analysis.</li>
<li>Added &lt;ctype.h> in gamgi_gtk_help_dialog.c, to avoid 
a warning silently accepted by gcc 3.3.4.</li>
<li>Removed a parsing error (void left) in gamgi_gtk_gamgi_exit,
silently accepted by gcc 3.3.4.</li>
<li>Tested and cleaned gamgi_phys_reciprocal.c, with shifted 
cell node origin: no bugs found.</li>
<li>Fixed a XML glitch in formats/text/create_contents.html.</li>
<li>Updated the documentation information on www.gamgi.org.</li>
<li>Added the tutorials on occupancy rules, nanostructure and RCP,
available from the documentation, to the interface Help subsystem.</li>
<li>Removed gamgi_math_cell_transform, replaced by 
gamgi_math_position_rotation, gamgi_math_position_translation.</li>
<li>Simplified the position code in gamgi_phys_plane,
gamgi_phys_direction, gamgi_phys_cell_link and gamgi_phys_rcp
(the cell center is no longer needed in these functions).</li>
<li>Found a old bug in the bond code: when the selected object has
only one of the atoms, bond->first changes when rotating, moving.
We think we have a good solution for this structural problem, even
for the future, when most objects will be allowed to have multiple, 
unlimited, parents: attribute ids to internal tasks.</li>
<li>Cracked a problem regarding rotation and translation 
of planes and directions imported from XML files.</li>
<li>Moved Cell->Measure to the new style and added Geometry and Voronoi
methods, as in Group-, Molecule- and Cluster->Measure dialogs.</li>
<li>Removed a simple bug just introduced in gamgi_gtk_direction_create.c, 
that crashed GAMGI when attempting to create an atomic direction.</li>
<li>Solved partially a positioning problem when importing atomic
planes, directions, with Partial Autonomy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Redesign Atom->Create and Atom->Modify, according with the new
notebook style, with more properties, including a wide range of atomic 
radius.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>

</div>

<div class="contents">

Improved the usability of the dialogs Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify.
Crystallographic and atomic planes and directions with Partial Autonomy, 
can now be arbitrarily positioned. Redesigned and reunited in a single file 
the code to position objects, which is now much more consistent, simpler, 
and easier to maintain. Replaced Layer, Plane, Direction enumerations by 
a common one, easier to understand. Replaced XML possible values yes,partial,no 
by all,partial,none, for visibility_in, visibility_out in layers and autonomy 
in planes, directions, to be consistent with the dialogs.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Temporarily disabled Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify, 
when the old or new Autonomy is All, until we find the best 
approach to the problems involved.</li>
<li>Harmonised the error messages when a feature is not supported yet.</li>
<li>Changing arbitrary positions for atomic planes and directions is 
now working fine, when done from Plane->Modify or Direction->Modify.</li>
<li>Simplified and improved the functions in gamgi_math_position.c</li>

are now working fine with arbitrary orientation and child objects.</li>
<li>Simplified the code handling position and orientation for cells,
planes, directions, making it much easier to understand and maintain.</li>
<li>The position of planes and directions is now reset before modifying 
them, in Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify, so the positions of the 
child objects are correct afterwards.</li>
<li>Updated formats documentation for layer and plane, direction.</li>
<li>In XML files, replaced parameters yes, partial, no, in layers 
(visibility_in, visibility_out), planes (autonomy) and directions 
(autonomy) by all, partial, none.</li>
<li>Replaced enumerations TRANSPARENT, TRANSLUCID, OPAQUE (layers) and
INDEPENDENT, AUTONOMOUS, AUTOMATIC (planes,directions) by a single 
enumeration ALL, PARTIAL, NONE.</li>
<li>Added gamgi_math_direction.c, currently to handle direction 
positioning code.</li>
<li>The positioning code for crystallographic planes and directions 
is now well tested and is working fine, after fixing a few rotation,
translation issues.</li>
<li>Crystallographic planes with autonomy Partial or All can
now be exported,imported with arbitrary position and orientation.</li>
<li>Plane,Direction position and orientation is now exported,
imported to XML files, when the autonomy is Partial or All.</li>
<li>When the type of plane,direction changes in Plane->Modify,
Direction->Modify, the same defaults as in Plane->Modify,
Direction->Create are shown.</li>
<li>Added GTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE macros to improve the interface 
behaviour in Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify.</li>
<li>Added rotation and translation to molecule and group containers.</li>
<li>Controling position and orientation in Plane->Modify is 
now working fine, for polygon crystallographic planes.</li>

<li>Fine tuned Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify behaviour. Fixed
default values for projection and autonomy parameters of
planes/directions.</li>
<li>Corrected a bug in gamgi_engine_find_object() when Gamgi is the 
selected object, and improved the code in gamgi_engine_find_object().
As a result simplified static_bond_parent() in gamgi_expat_export.</li>
</ul>

<div>GAMGI 0.12.9</div><div>31th August 2007</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Fixed a bug in the Wigner-Seitz cell code that crashed GAMGI when
applying space group information, with more than one Wyckoff position
(thanks Pedro, for spotting this one!). Point Symmetry and Voronoi 
tesselation analysis can now be done for Group, Molecule and Cluster

properly identify the reference used to build these objects.</li>
<li>Added checks for atom parents when creating atomic planes,
directions.</li>
<li>New direction modes Automatic, Autonomous, Independent are
implemented and working fine.</li>
<li>New plane modes Automatic, Autonomous, Independent are 
working fine. Key atoms cannot have planes, directions as parents.
Key atoms are reordered in the beginning.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in gamgi_expat_import afecting Plane,Direction 
projection: default mode must be added here, when cell is known.</li>
<li>Changed again Plane and Direction dependency rules: futurely
these objects will have Automatic, Autonomous or Independent types
of connection with the defining objects, Cell or Atoms.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in gamgi_gtk_object_independent: returned FALSE 
instead of TRUE, so objects could not link.</li> 
<li>Fixed a bug in gamgi_phys_plane_atoms, gamgi_phys_direction_atoms:
atom positions must be projected when added to polygon, line.</li>
<li>Updated phys, gtk, mesa code to handle the new 
link,thickness parameters for plane,direction.</li>
<li>The 04 menu is now handled in a common way (and solved 
a little bug) in Cell, Plane and Direction dialogs.</li>
<li>Fixed the behaviour for dialogs Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify.</li>
<li>Fixed the layout for dialogs Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify.</li>
<li>Improved the way Link and Thickness parameters are handled 
in dialogs Plane->Create and Direction->Create.</li>
<li>Created the dialogs Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify.</li>
<li>Fixed the xyz format, to conform with the usual specification 
of this format: element names instead of numbers and a comment 
second line.</li>
<li>Corrected a bug in the Voronoi code: in some cases,
the borders limit could be zero, triggering nans. In principle
this affected speed only. Cleaned the Voronoi code.</li>
<li>Updated the GAMGI XML files with planes,directions in stereographic
projections, to work with the new model parameter.</li>
<li>Poles and Traces for a given plane,direction in a stereographic
projection are now created as independent objects.</li>
<li>Changed the way used to control the representation of planes 
and directions. The XML parameters plane, trace, polygon have been 
replaced by a single parameter model, with values: pole, trace, polygon, 
line, reciprocal.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Replace set/get_data functions by structures
defined in gtk/gamgi_object.h headers.</li>
<li>Add Contents and Container options in Object->Remove dialogs.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>

<div class="contents">

Implemented the dialogs Window->Copy, Layer->Copy, Light->Copy,
Assembly->Copy, Cell->Copy, Cluster->Copy, Molecule->Copy, Group->Copy, 
Text->Copy. Wrote two tutorials showing how to use the occupancy rules 
implemented in GAMGI, to build non-crystalline structures with cells.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The window and layer containing the copied objects now raise 
automatically to the top and are set as current layer and object.</li>
<li>Implemented the dialog Window->Copy, in gamgi_gtk_window_copy.c.
Data not copied (in gamgi_engine_copy_out_window) must be initialized.</li>

<div class="contents">

Global selection between layers is implemented, making object 
linking operations much easier. Implemented the dialog Atom->Copy. 
Implemented the Link All method in the Window->Link dialog.
Reorganized the Gtk window code. Wrote documentation for the 
Object->Link dialogs and Atom->Copy. Updated the documentation 
for Object->Measure dialogs, plus Plane->Create and 
Direction->Create dialogs.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Updated the documentation for the dialogs Plane->Create and
Direction->Create.</li>
<li>Updated Help->Current and Help->Tutorial dialogs, to include all
the help files about the new Link->Object dialogs, plus the Atom->Copy 
dialog.</li>
<li>Removed a memory leak added in the previous release in the code
to avoid half-bonds in linked objects (a list was not removed). Added 
a simple but general procedure to avoid half-bonds, when copying objects. 
So far only implemented in the Atom->Copy dialog.</li>
<li>Reorganized the Gtk window code: created gamgi_gtk_window_remove.*
files, renamed gamgi_gtk_window.* to gamgi_gtk_window_create.*,
cleaned code in gamgi_gtk_reset.* and gamgi_gtk_exit.* files.</li>
<li>The method link All, in the Window->Link dialog, is implemented.</li>
<li>Updated the documentation for Plane->Measure and 
Direction->Measure dialogs.</li>
<li>Updated the documentation for the Atom->Measure dialog.</li>
<li>Added documentation for the new Atom->Copy dialog.</li>
<li>Added documentation for all the new Object->Link dialogs.</li>
<li>The first Copy dialog, dialog Atom->Copy, is now fully operational.</li>
<li>Created the dialog Atom->Copy, in gamgi_gtk_atom_copy.c.</li>
<li>Cleaned code in gamgi_mesa_select.c.</li>
<li>A friend pointed us to a GPL code to calculate diffraction 
patterns. This promises to be very useful to GAMGI.</li>
<li>Linking objects is now greatly simplified, as objects not in the
current layer (in the same or in a different window) can be easily
selected.</li>
<li>In Object->Link dialogs, the second object address is now global 
for all linking methods (In Cell->Link, this address was global only 
for the Object linking method).</li>

<div>GAMGI 0.12.2</div><div>6th November 2006</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

This is essentially a bug-fix release, correcting several
problems related mostly with the new Object->Link dialogs
implemented in the previous release and with the graphic engine.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Found and removed a bug in gamgi_mesa_select.c: when a window
was selected, the raised and updated window was the current one.</li>
<li>Removed a GlFlush() and a glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
in gamgi_mesa_drawing and a gtk_widget_queue_draw (window->area)
in gamgi_mesa_scan. They seem to be all redundant.</li>
<li>Wrote and tested code to pick objects in other 
layers below the current layer, with the mouse.
This is needed for eficient object linking.</li>
<li>Cleaned the local,global object selection code,
in gamgi_mesa_area.c and gamgi_mesa_select.c files.</li>
<li>Found and removed a long standing bug: in Orthographic
Layers, when creating new objects as Texts, Cells, Atoms, 
with the mouse, a very large z coordinate was given to them,
when no other object was already there. Now the new objects 
receive the same depth as the Center of the current Layer 
(Orthographic or in Perspective).</li>
<li>Fixed the way atom scaling was done in gamgi_mesa_draw_atom
and gamgi_mesa_scan_atom: it worked fine for the atoms, but not 
for the child objects, as texts.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in gamgi_gtk_select_ctree_bond: the nodes describing
texts linked to bonds were duplicated, because the corresponding 
function call was called twice.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in gamgi_mesa_draw.c: when child objects were
linked to bonds, they would change the atom color.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in gamgi_mesa_rotate.c and gamgi_mesa_translate.c:
rotation, translation data only propagated to bond child elements
when the selected object was the bond.</li>
<li>Added Bond to the list of objects that can be linked above
in Text->Link dialogs. This was missing before.</li>
<li>Removed a bug in static_clean in gamgi_gtk_bond_link.c,
crashing GAMGI because the menu_above does not exist here.</li>
<li>Fixed the link between layers and objects containing bonds to
atoms outside: these bonds are now automatically removed before
the link is applied.</li>
<li>Fixed the link between windows and layers (before a crash would
take place when the layer was the last one or the current one).</li>
<li>When the last layer is removed or linked to a different window,
a new layer is now automatically created (before, the action was 
refused and an error message was shown).</li>
<li>Improved static_reset, static_clean, in gamgi_gtk_*_link.c functions,
to handle better Object->Link dialogs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify functionality.</li>
<li>Replace set/get_data functions by structures
defined in gtk/gamgi_object.h headers.</li>
<li>Add Object->Copy dialogs with basic copy functionality.</li>
<li>Add Contents and Container options in Object->Remove dialogs.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
<li>Implement global selection, including global picking
algorithms and selection dialogs that include all the
selection methods.</li>
<li>Implement multiple object picking, including a
dynamic frame with moving ants and dragging anchors,
to select multiple objects and images from the screen.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed screenshot links in www.gamgi.org.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in Cluster->Measure: when
trying to perform a Voronoi tesselation from a Voronoi output 
cluster, GAMGI was not properly checking for the absence of 
atoms, resulting in a segmentation fault.</li>
<li>Added a tutorial on how to build RCP structures.</li>
<li>Website improvements: dynamic images, new screenshots, 
repaired broken links.</li>
