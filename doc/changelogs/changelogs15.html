<div>GAMGI 0.16</div><div>6th August 2012</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

This release formally completes the work started in October 2009
with GAMGI 0.14.2 to handle lists of objects everywhere in GAMGI.
Fixed bugs in Group->Modify, Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify,
so these tasks are now more solid and powerful, for single objects
and lists of objects. Upgraded documentation for all Object->Modify
task dialogs. Upgraded Help->Current and Help->Topic accordingly.
Added three more copper oxide superconductor structure and info files.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Synced gamgi/ and gamgi_exp/ source, data and documentation trees.</li>
<li>Solved a problem in Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify preventing many
useful tasks: previously old planes, directions were removed and replaced by
new instances, so Lists could not be used to modify Type, Scope properties.</li>
<li>Added info and structure files for supercondutors Pb2Sr2YCu3O8 and PbBaYSrCu3O8.</li>
<li>Improved Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify: when List is selected,
Reference must be Local, as Cell and Atoms modes are not possible.</li>
<li>Updated Group->Modify, Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify.</li>
<li>Updated documentation for Layer->Modify, Cell->Modify, Light->Modify.</li>
<li>Updated documentation for Text->Modify, Bond->Modify, Atom->Modify.</li>
<li>Fixed two little bugs in gamgi_gtk_group_modify.c: cache.radius should be
initialized to DBL_MAX, not 0.0; the dialog should be directed to ...GROUP_MODIFY,
not ...GROUP_CREATE, involving different documentation files.</li>
<li>Updated documentation for Plane->Modify, Direction->Modify, Group->Create,
Group->Modify.</li>
<li>Updated Help->Current and Help->Topic for Group->Create and Group->Modify.</li>
<li>Started updating documentation for all Object->Modify dialogs.</li>
<li>Created the structure and info files for Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 superconductor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="contents">

Fixed a serious bug in all gamgi_engine_filter functions, that could result in crashes, namely in Plane->Create and Direction->Create.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Synced gamgi_0.15.8 and gamgi_exp_0.15.8.</li>

and Style for all objects inside a Container Group.</li>
<li>Group->Modify is essentially done, with objects and lists
of objects, for all types: Container, Polytope and Local.</li>
<li>Modifying Groups to types Container and Polytope is now working
fine in Group->Modify.</li>

they are still used to build polytopes but are not saved anymore.</li>
<li>Fixed the new Group->Modify interface.</li>
<li>Removed parameters Structure, Filter, Visible, Coplanar from Group
objects: they are still used to build polytopes but are not saved anymore.</li>
<li>Improved dialogs: Cell->Link, Group->Create and Group->Modify.</li>
<li>Another superconductor structure: Tl2Ba2Ca4Cu5O14.</li>

Bi2Sr2(Gd,Ce)2Cu2O10, and Pb2(Sr,La)2Cu2O6.</li>
<li>A third crash on Atom->Select->Region after static_grab_pixels.
Removed the O3 optimization to see if the problem subsists.</li>
<li>Another crash on Atom->Select->Region, after static_grab_pixels,
this time compiled with -g.</li>

<li>Added structures for chiral nanotubes to dat/mplecule/nanotubes.</li>
<li>Found and removed a serious bug in gamgi_engine_filter.c functions:
dlist nodes were called after being removed... This might explain also
a crash reported earlier in static_grab_objects from Atom->Select
with Method Region.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>

<div class="contents">

Fixed space groups 119, 120, 121, 122. Solved a problem with interactive
handling lists of recursive objects. Fixed new and old bugs in light scaling,
Layer->Modify, Plane->Create. Fixed a bug in ClCs tutorial, fixed
outdated interstice cell data files. Created xml and info txt data files
for the most relevant cfc, bcc, hcp derived cristalline structures.
Implemented a dialog to generate lists of families of crystallographic
planes. Implemented a unique task identifier, to futurely handle operations
such as drawing in a safer way.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added the most important cristalline structures
derived from cfc, bcc, hcp to dat/cell/structures.</li>
<li>Synced gamgi/ and gamgi_exp/ code trees.</li>
<li>Found and removed a recent bug in scale code:
individual lights were not scaling with the mouse.</li>
<li>Fixed dat/cell/interstices/ files that still used type
instead of label to designate atom types.</li>
<li>Built Chalcopyrite with space group 122: the structure is correct.</li>
<li>Space groups 119, 120, 121, 122 were given as P groups, should be I. Fixed.
Group 119 had positions a,b,c,d with symmetry -42m, should be -4m2. Fixed.
Checked lattice and symmetry labels for all other tetragonal groups:
they are correct. Checked Wyckoff positions for groups 119, 120,
121, 122: they are correct.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in Plane->Create: area tolerance
to dismiss plane creation in a range is too small.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in Layer->Modify: layer names were not copied.</li>
<li>Started buiding a comprehensive data base of representative
crystallographic structures, based on the book "Structure of Materials,
by M. de Graef and M. E. McHenry".</li>
<li>Designed a GTK dialog to handle lists of crystallographic planes
in Plane->Create.</li>
<li>Fixed a HTML glitch in the CsCl tutorial.</li>
<li>Started building a dialog to create ranges of crystallographic planes.</li>
<li>Replaced the id mechanism to handle translation, rotation
of lists of recursive objects, by the much simpler, slightly faster,
marking algorithm that also works for scaling. Rotation, translation,
scaling of lists of recursive objects works fine now, and the
new algorithm does not interfere with all the other translation,
rotation mechanisms devised earlier. This essentially completes the
conceptual work, planned 10 years ago, but only initiated in October
2009, to handle lists of objects exactly as a single object.</li>
<li>Designed, implemented a simple, fast algorithm to scale lists
of recursive objects. It works also for rotations, translations.</li>
<li>Started working on gamgi_gtk_plane_set.c and gamgi_gtk_direction_set.c,
to create flexible sets of crystallographic planes and directions.</li>
<li>A unique id number is now generated for all rotation tasks,
for example to avoid repetitions when rotating lists of recursive
objects.</li>
<li>A unique id number is now generated for all translation tasks,
for example to avoid repetitions when translating lists of recursive
objects, such as texts, groups, clusters or assemblies.</li>
</ul>

Global lists of pre-selected objects can now be rotated, translated,
scaled exactly as before for a local single object (to grab focus
for a list of objects, just press the mouse middle button over the
corresponding object class button, in the main menu, and then over
the Gamgi button). Updated all the local and web documentation for
Object->Copy and Object->Link dialogs, available for example through
the Help tools.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Synced gamgi/src and gamgi_exp/src code branches.</li>
<li>Synced all the interfaces documentation: www.gamgi.org,
ftp.gamgi.org, gamgi_doc and gamgi-exp_doc. Fixed a tag
position inconsistency in CSS notebook code.</li>
<li>Updated the documentation for all the Object->Link dialogs.</li>
<li>When giving focus to a list of objects, now checks first
if the list is empty.</li>
<li>Updated the documentation for all the Object->Copy dialogs.</li>
<li>Fixed a little GUI bug in Layer->Copy: (disable Local in
object mode).</li>
<li>Developed a flexible, simple, fast, mechanism to identify each
instance of tasks such as rotating and drawing with a unique id,
to properly handle multi reentrance in the same object.</li>
<li>Removed gamgi_global_selection_draw, replaced
by equal function gamgi_mesa_draw_gamgi.</li>
<li>Added code to implement task ids: tasks such as drawing,
scaling, rotating, translating will have a unique id attached,
to prevent bugs in objects with multiple parents, such as bonds,
and lists of recursive objects, such as texts, groups, clusters
and assemblies.</li>
<li>Lists of pre-selected objects can now be interactively scaled
(dragging the mouse or clicking the ruler), exactly as before for
a single object.</li>
<li>Lists of pre-selected objects can now be interactively translated
(dragging the mouse or clicking the ruler), exactly as before for
a single object. It works quite fast for 1500 atoms, on two different
windows!</li>
<li>Lists of pre-selected objects can now be interactively
rotated (dragging the mouse or clicking the ruler), exactly
as before for a single object (needs more testing).</li>
<li>Code disabling selection lists when listed objects are
removed is now also disabling global focus for those lists.</li>
<li>We are a step closer to rotate,move,scale lists of previously
selected objects: code to select objects or lists of objects,
including statusbar info and all the required internal data
(just gamgi->focus), are now working fine.</li>

Coordination polyhedra groups and Voronoi polyhedra clusters can now
be exported/imported from GAMGI XML files. Polygon planes and Line
directions can also be exported/imported from GAMGI XML files, as
totally independent objects, so they don't depend anymore from Cell
or Atom objects. Planes and Directions represented in stereographic
projections can now be scaled as any other object. Improved the
functionality offered in Plane->Create, Direction->Create and
Group->Create (Structure and Filter menus). Removed all the code
involving the ugly concept of dependency, envolving Plane, Direction
and Group objects. Direction->Measure and Plane->Measure now
can calculate also the geometrical area and length, respectively.
Fixed bugs in Bond->Create and Direction->Measure and cleaned code.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>For the first time, polytope Groups can now be
imported,exported to XML files, with the new data model.</li>
<li>Directions can be imported/exported again to XML files, with
the new data model. All types of directions seem to be working fine.</li>
<li>Planes can be imported/exported again to XML files, with the new data
model. All types of planes seem to be working fine, except planes on the
reciprocal lattice.</li>
<li>Cracked down the way to properly position Planes, Directions
and Groups imported from polygonal data in XML files.</li>
<li>Fixed a new bug in Reciprocal lattice: when selecting a plane,
it would wrongly move, rotate the cross.</li>
<li>Planes, Directions cannot be linked to another object when they
are not polygons, lines (Stereographic projection, reciprocal lattice.</li>
<li>Measuring area, length, with Plane->Measure, Direction->Measure just
produces an error when Plane, Direction is not a polygon, line.</li>
<li>Plane->Measure, Direction->Measure for crystalographic Planes, Directions
works fine when parent is no longer a Cell, producing just an error.</li>
<li>Crystalographic Planes, Directions now can still exist when parent
is no longer a Cell, when they are polygons or lines.</li>
<li>Voronoi clusters and Coordination groups can now be exported,
imported, still with limitations: position and orientation data
is still missing.</li>
<li>All polygon data can now be exported and imported from GAMGI XML files.</li>
<li>Most of the code to import polygon data, to describe Clusters,
Groups, Planes, Directions, in a easy and solid way, is now in place.</li>
<li>Plane->Measure and Direction->Measure now support plane
geometrical area and direction geometric length.</li>
<li>Added functions to calculate Plane geometrical area
and Direction geometrical length.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in Direction->Measure: the distance between nodes in some
cases was a multiple of the correct value, for centered lattices.</li>
<li>Wrote code to build polygon arrays from XML files.</li>
<li>glPolygonOffset is now (1,1) for Planes and (2,2)
for Cells, so Planes have visual priority over Cells.</li>
<li>Planes rendered as polygons now have a border, with
the background color, which is good to distinguish them.</li>
<li>Completed a full review of the functionality for Plane->Create,
Direction->Create and Group->Create.</li>
<li>The Structure options are now fully working on Plane->Create
and Direction->Create (similar to Autonomy options before).</li>
<li>Improved Plane->Create, Direction->Create: now there are
4 different policies to filter atoms in Planes, Directions.</li>
<li>Improved Group->Create: now there are 4 different policies
to filter atoms around central atom.</li>
<li>Improved gamgi_chem_polytope code: the number of Planes, Directions
created, and ignored Groups, due to improper atom coordinates are now
fully reported.</li>
<li>Fixed a new bug in Bond->Remove: graphic area not immediately
refreshed, in Local mode.</li>
<li>Introduced a new parameter Structure, meaning how
atoms are transported to new object: Copy, Link or None.</li>
<li>Got rid of gamgi_phys_plane_compatible, gamgi_phys_direction_compatible:
another ugly concept that does not solve the issue: atom superposition.</li>
<li>Planes and Directions in stereographic projections and reciprocal lattice
now can be scaled as any other object (increasing/decreasing the width).</li>
<li>Planes and Directions in Trace mode (in Projection Cells) can
now be scaled (changing line width) exactly as any other object.</li>
<li>GAMGI can now export array data everytime that is necessary,
for example in Clusters, Groups, Planes and Directions.</li>
<li>Removed gamgi_chem_atom_unlink: removing atoms should
never remove automatically container objects. If it makes
sense or not that is a user prorrogative. This represents
a change in policy, in how to handle planes, directions and
groups. These objects can be handled, exported, imported even
if they cannot be fully reconstructed. gamgi_chem_atom_unlink,
gamgi_gtk_object_independence and autonomy code were among the
ugliest code in GAMGI.</li>
<li>Removed test function gamgi_gtk_object_independence:
all objects must be fully independent and can be save to
files. If it makes sense or not that is a user prorrogative.</li>
<li>Removed parameter Autonomy from Plane, Direction and Group
objects. Futurely these objects will always have Autonomy All.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Add plane area and direction length to Plane->Measure and
Direction->Measure.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
</ul>
