Change here position and orientation for a single cell or a list of cells.

<p/>

To modify an cell, click over its graphic image, or write its identification
(name and number) on the <b>Cell</b> entry. To modify a list of cells, press
the button <b>List</b> (after creating the list of cells with <b>Cell->Select</b>).
Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change an cell name write the new name in the <b>Cell</b> entry,
followed by the cell number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the cell).
To change the name for a list of cells, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Translation</h3>

The origin of a cell object, defined by its (0 0 0) node,
can be changed using the <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> entries.

<p/>

By default, in <b>Conventional</b>, <b>Primitive</b> and 
<b>Parallelepiped</b> volumes, this node is at a corner 
of the cell volume, in a <b>Sphere</b> volume it is at the 
center, and in a <b>Wigner</b> volume it is at the center of 
the first Wigner-Seitz cell.

<p/>

To define exactly the cell translation, relatively to other cell 
or relatively to the current layer, press <a href="translation.html">
Align</a>.

<h3>Rotation</h3>

The orientation of a cell object, defined by the Euler angles theta,
phi, psi, can be changed using the <b>E1</b>, <b>E2</b>, <b>E3</b> entries.

<p/>

Euler angles in GAMGI are defined as follows: first, the (x, y, z)
referential is rotated theta degrees (between 0 and 180) around the
y axis, then the referential is rotated phi degrees (between 0 and 360)
around the initial z axis, and finally it is rotated psi degrees (between
0 and 360) around the new z axis, always in the direct, counter-clockwise,
direction. If the first Euler angle (theta) is zero, the old and new z axis
coincide, thus (0, 0, 10) and (0, 5, 5) represent the same rotation.

<p/>

By default, the first conventional vector is aligned with the x axis 
(even if conventional vectors are not actually represented), the second 
vector is in the xy plane and the third vector has a positive z coordinate 
(pointing to the user), corresponding to Euler angles (0, 0, 0).

<p/>

The cell orientation is independent of the volume representation.
This way, conventional, primitive and Wigner-Seitz cells can be easily 
compared, as they have the same orientation.

<p/>

To define exactly the cell rotation, relatively to other cell 
or relatively to the current layer, press <a href="rotation.html">
