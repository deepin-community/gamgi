Chose the method of analysis: <b>Geometry</b>, <b>Symmetry</b> or <b>Voronoi</b>.

<h3>Geometry</h3>

This method measures all the bond lengths, angles and torsions in the 
structure, reporting for each quantity, the number of occurrences, the
minimum and maximum values, the average value and the standard deviation.
Geometric relations between non bonded atoms are ignored.

<p/>

Undefined bond angles (when at least two atoms are coincident) are reported
for each angle sequence. Undefined bond torsions (when at least two atoms
are coincident or three atoms are colinear) are reported for each torsion
sequence.

<h3>Symmetry</h3>

This method determines the point group of symmetry of the structure, either
in the chemical context (infinite groups, all symmetry operations are 
allowed) or in the crystallographic context (32 groups, only 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 
rotations and other operations compatible with lattice symmetry are allowed).

<h3>Voronoi</h3>

This method determines the Voronoi tesselation of the structure,
shows the resulting polyhedra in a new layer, and reports a large 
list of its most important geometrical and topological properties.

<p/>

This analysis can be made with planar bondaries (to close the 
outside polyhedra) or with full periodic boundary conditions,
with equal weights for all atoms (the usual Voronoi tesselation) 
or with a different weight for each atom (given by its atomic 
radius, the so-called radical tesselation).
