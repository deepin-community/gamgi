Link a direction or a list of directions to other objects.

<h3>Hierarchy</h3>

Directions can be linked to objects above or below, in the Gamgi hierarchy. 
Pressing the button <b>Below</b> (the default), the class menu 
shows the classes of objects that can be owned by directions. Pressing
the button <b>Above</b>, the same menu shows the classes of objects that
can own directions.

<p/>

Gamgi expects users to identify first the direction or list of directions
and then the object to link. When the <b>Direction</b> entry is active 
and empty, clicking the mouse over a direction, on the current layer
(local selection), its identification is transported to the <b>Direction</b> 
entry. Pressing the <b>List</b> button, the current list of directions
is selected instead.

<p/>

Gamgi is now expecting users to click on a object of the class 
currently selected in the class menu. This object can be in 
a different layer or window (global selection). 

<p/>

To select a visible object, just press the mouse over the object,
in its window. To select objects without visual representation, such
as layers and lights, press the mouse over the graphic area in the window,
to create a menu with all the objects of that class in the window,
which can then be selected.

<h3>Method</h3>

Gamgi suppports only one method to link directions: <b>Object</b>.

<p/>

The <b>Object</b> method links a direction or a list of directions
to a single object, <b>Above</b> or <b>Below</b>.

<p/>

When the <b>Hierarchy</b> is <b>Above</b>, the direction is unlinked from 
its current parent and linked to the new object. When the direction is
moved to a different layer, its bonds are automatically removed.
When the <b>Hierarchy</b> is <b>Below</b>, the child object is
unlinked from its current parent and linked to the direction. An error
is issued when the parent already owned the child object.

<p/>

After the linking operation, Gamgi always puts on top
the window and layer containing the linked objects.

<p/>

When linking a list of directions <b>Above</b>, all directions in the list
are unlinked and linked to the parent object. When linking a list
of directions <b>Below</b>, the child object is replicated as many times
as necessary to link each direction in the list to a different replica.
