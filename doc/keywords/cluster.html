Cluster is an object container, designed to contain an unlimited number of chemical species as child objects, including other clusters, molecules, groups, atoms and related objects as texts, orbitals, directions and planes. A cluster is therefore a recursive object, with unlimited nested levels, and its properties should reflect the child chemical features. The low-level engine infra-structure required to implement cluster objects is fully implemented but everything else is not done yet.
