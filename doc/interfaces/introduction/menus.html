The GAMGI main interface is divided in 5 distinct sections, from top to bottom: 
Menus, Drawing, Tools, Commands and Status. 

<p/>

Most GAMGI functionality is available through the object-oriented Menus. 
Each menu entry has the name of an object and is the entering point for 
all tasks related with that object. For the sake of consistency, even 
Help, File and Gamgi are regarded as objects. Objects are presented in 
hierarchical order, when performing a direct (counter-clockwise) rotation, 
from bottom left to top left.

<p/>

Help objects are at the bottom of the hierarchy, because they have the responsibility 
of explaining all the other GAMGI objects. Help facilities in GAMGI are accessed 
through the Help menu only.

<p/>

The 17 objects that provide all the real functionality in GAMGI come next, represented 
by menus with their names: Text, Orbital, Bond, Atom, Direction, Plane, Group, Molecule, 
Cluster, Cell, Arrow, Shape, Graph, Assembly, Light, Layer and Window.

<p/>

Files comes next in the hierarchy, because they can include and describe all the 
previous objects. Input/output operations in GAMGI are accessed through the 
File menu only.

<p/>

Finally, global aspects of GAMGI functionality are controlled through 
the Gamgi menu, which is therefore the highest object in the hierarchy.

<p/>

To request a task related with any of these objects, press the mouse (left button) 
over the corresponding menu label in the window. This pops up a second menu allowing 
to choose which kind of task to accomplish: Current, Topic, Search, General, Tutorial, 
Remote, for Help; Create, Copy, Select, Link, Modify, Measure, Animate, Remove, for 
the 17 functional objects; Import, Export, for File; About, Reset, Exit, for Gamgi.
