A mouse is essential to select objects and to use GAMGI efficiently.

<h3>Object selection</h3>

Pressing, with the left button, one of the object labels on the top 
menu area, pops up a menu with all the available tasks for that object, 
which can subsequentially be selected with the mouse or with the keyboard.

<p/>

Pressing a label in the main menu (above the window drawing area), 
with the middle button, means that the user is about to select an 
object of that class. If this class has a visual representation 
(atom, bond, molecule, cell, etc.), subsequently pressing the mouse 
over the visual representation of an object of this class results 
in the selection of the object.

<p/>

If the selected class has no visual representation (light, layer, window, 
gamgi), or the visual representation is ambiguous, when it belongs to 
more than one object of the selected class (possible in recursive objects 
such as text, group, cluster, assembly), then a menu pops up, listing
the possible objects, and allowing the selection of one, with the mouse 
or the keyboard.

<p/>

A convenient short-cut to select the current layer, the current window
and the current gamgi (everything), is to press twice over <b>Layer</b>, 
<b>Window</b> and <b>Gamgi</b> respectively, on the main menu.

<h3>Dragging and pressing</h3>

Dragging the mouse over the window drawing area changes the selected 
object when <b>Axes</b> is off and the layer referential when <b>Axes</b>
is on: 1) pressing the left button rotates the object (referential) 
around its geometric center along the three X,Y,Z axes: dragging 
horizontally rotates along the vertical axis, dragging vertically 
rotates along the horizontal axis, and dragging along a circular arc 
far from the center rotates along the axis perpendicular to the screen; 
2) pressing the center button moves the object (referential) in the 
dragging direction; 3) pressing the right button up and down scales 
the object (layer) up and down respectively.

<p/>

This functionality is available even for objects without visual 
representation, as lights. Dragging and pressing the left button 
when a directional or spot light is selected, changes the light 
direction. Dragging and pressing the middle button for a positional 
light, changes the light position. Dragging and pressing the right 
button for a spot light, changes the light angle.

<p/>

When a task window for a given object class is open (as <b>Atom Create</b>,
<b>Layer Modify</b> or <b>Bond Remove</b>), GAMGI attempts to use any mouse 
pressing over the drawing area to recognize an object of the same class, 
using the criteria described above to select an object (with 
or without visual representation).

<p/>

When an object is found, its information is usually transported 
to the task window (and in some cases automatically executed), 
but this object does not replace the current object, which always
needs to be explicitly selected: the two picking modes are independent.

<p/>

To select an atom, for example, when <b>Molecule Measure</b> is open, 
just press the middle button over the <b>Atom</b> label on the main menu 
and click the mouse over the atom visual representation. Clicking again 
over the same atom, this time GAMGI is not expecting an object selection, 
so the default picking mode is executed and the molecule owning the atom 
is measured.

<h3>Ruler handling</h3>

Pressing on <b>Rotate</b>, <b>Move</b>, or <b>Scale</b> (below the 
window drawing area) activates the positional ruler. This ruler is
algebraic, centered around 0: for positive (counter-colockwise) changes, 
click on the right side of the ruler and for larger changes, click 
farther away from the ruler center. 

<p/>

Pressing again on <b>rotate</b>, <b>move</b>, or <b>scale</b> disables 
the ruler and its position returns to zero. Everytime an action is 
active, its label in the tool bar is highlighted, showing the default 
color again when disabled.
