There are four different types of windows in GAMGI: 
1) top windows; task windows; exclusive windows and help windows. 

<h3>Top</h3>

Top windows are GAMGI main windows, when GAMGI starts a top window is created.
Memory permiting, an unlimited number of these windows can be open simultaneously, 
and objects can be freely moved from a window to another. These windows are 
independent: if GAMGI starts with window A and then window B is created,
these windows have exactly the same priority, so removing 
window A will leave GAMGI running normally with window B.

<h3>Task</h3>

Task windows are all the dialogs related with tasks selected from 
the main menu in top windows. Throughout GAMGI documentation task windows 
are named first by the object, then by the task, and if necessary by the 
specific topic, as in <b>Molecule Measure Symmetry</b>.

<p/>

Task windows include input dialogs, such as <b>Atom Create</b>, where users enter 
information and output dialogs, as <b>Cluster Measure Voronoi</b> where analysis 
data is reported. Task windows also include the <b>Help</b> input windows, such 
as <b>Help Topic</b>, where users select the documentation they need.

<p/>

Task windows do not require exclusive attention, and after opening a task window 
users can still use all the menus and facilities provided by the other windows.

<p/>

For the sake of simplicity, only one task can be active at a given time in GAMGI, 
thus selecting <b>Light->Modify</b> after <b>Atom->Create</b> will close automatically 
the <b>Atom Create</b> window before opening the <b>Light Modify</b> window.

<p/>

However, some tasks can open more than one window simultaneously, for example, selecting 
<b>Atom->Create</b> opens a first window and then selecting <b>Table</b> opens a second 
window. Selecting another task will automatically remove both windows. Removing the first 
window automatically removes the second. Removing the second window leaves the first 
unchanged.

<p/>

When multiple top windows are open simultaneously, the task is executed in the window 
where the task was selected. Task windows are automatically removed when the corresponding 
top window is removed.

<h3>Exclusive</h3>

Exclusive windows are windows that require exclusive attention, because some sensitive 
operation is occurring, so users are not allowed to perform any other operation until 
handling properly this issue, not even consulting the Help.

<p/>

There are three types of exclusive windows in GAMGI: message, confirmation and history. 
Message windows usually show an error or warning message and only expect users to click 
on a <b>Cancel</b> button to remove the window.

<p/>

Confirmation windows usually prompts a question, asking users to confirm some sensitive task, 
as in <b>Gamgi Reset</b> and <b>Gamgi Exit</b>. Users can confirm the task, pressing the 
<b>Ok</b> button, or cancel it, pressing the <b>Cancel</b> button (always the default option).

<p/>

History windows are used to handle <b>Undo</b> and <b>Save</b> tools, and must be 
exclusive because GAMGI is in a fragile state when navigating through old configurations.

<h3>Help</h3>

Windows showing GAMGI documentation are help windows, including 
<b>Help Start</b>. However, windows to select the documentation, 
such as <b>Help Search</b>, are task windows.

<p/>

Help windows are independent from task windows: they can be open 
simultaneously, without interference. For example, a user may be reading 
<b>Help Bond Create</b> while <b>Atom Create</b> is open. However, GAMGI 
knows which task is active, so selecting <b>Help Current</b> the current 
help window is replaced by <b>Help Atom Create</b>. 

<p/>

Help windows do not require exclusive attention, and after opening a help 
window users can still use all the menus and facilities provided by the other 
windows.

<p/>

For the sake of simplicity, only one help window can be active at a given time 
in GAMGI, thus selecting <b>Help->Current</b> when <b>Atom Create</b> is open,
will close automatically any previous help window before opening
<b>Help Atom Create</b>. 

<p/>

However, more than one window related with the <b>Help</b> system can be open 
simultaneously. For example, selecting <b>Help->Topic</b> opens a task window 
and then selecting a topic opens a help window. Selecting another help topic
automatically removes the help window before showing the one. Removing the task 
window does not remove the help window. 

<p/>

Help windows do not produce active actions (even tutorial help windows only tell 
users what to do), so they are not attached to a particular top window. When several 
top windows are open simultaneously and one is removed, help windows are not affected, 
even if this was the top window used to call the help window.
