GAMGI exports files to the following formats: <b>xml</b>, <b>xyz</b>,
<b>x3d</b>, <b>png</b>, <b>jpeg</b>, <b>tiff</b>, by simply writing the
filename with this extension name in the <b>File->Export</b> dialog.

<p/>

GAMGI imports files from the following formats: <b>xml</b>, <b>xyz</b>,
by simply writing the filename with this extension name in the
<b>File->Import</b> dialog.

<h3>xml</h3>

This is the GAMGI native file format to import and export everything in GAMGI,
including object and config data. It uses all the advantages of the XML text
file specifications. The specific format used in GAMGI is described in detail
in the documentation, in <b>Help->Topic->Formats</b>. GAMGI exports only
the contents of the current object.

<h3>xyz</h3>

This is a simple file format to describe sets of atoms. It is very convenient
to import and export atomic data to and from other sources. Essentially,
the first line indicates the number of atoms, the second line is a comment,
and then each line contains the chemical element and the x,y,z coordinates
of a single atom. GAMGI exports only the atoms belonging to the current object.

<h3>x3d</h3>

This is the modern XML version of the VRML text file format specification,
to describe 3D graphic scenes, with all sorts of objects and lights. GAMGI
exports only the current layer of the current window, with everything inside,
to X3D format.

<h3>png, jpeg, tiff</h3>

GAMGI exports the entire pixel representation of the current window, as
a single image, to one of these formats. GAMGI also accepts the three letter
names commonly used in some operating systems: jpg and tif.

<p/>

Initially Gamgi creates a ppm file of the entire screen of the current
window, and then uses the standalone facilities pnmtopng, pnmtojpeg and
pnmtotiff (commonly available in Unix/Linux/BSD systems) to convert to
png, jpeg and tiff file formats.
