Change here the volume representation for a single cell or a list of cells.

<p/>

To modify an cell, click over its graphic image, or write its identification
(name and number) on the <b>Cell</b> entry. To modify a list of cells, press
the button <b>List</b> (after creating the list of cells with <b>Cell->Select</b>).
Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change an cell name write the new name in the <b>Cell</b> entry,
followed by the cell number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the cell).
To change the name for a list of cells, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Type</h3>

Lattices can be represented using <b>Conventional</b>, <b>Primitive</b> 
or <b>Wigner-Seitz</b> cells, plus filtering volumes such as a 
<b>Parallelepiped</b> or a <b>Sphere</b>. Lattices can also be represented 
by the stereographic <b>Projection</b> of its crystallographic planes 
and directions (added by users, after the projection is created).

<p/>

Cells with a <b>Hexagonal</b> system and a rhombohedral <b>R</b> lattice
(corresponding to the seven R space groups when using the standard Hermann-Mauguin
symbols), are always represented using the hexagonal axes and the obverse setting,
when the chosen type is <b>Conventional</b>, and the rombohedral axes, when the
chosen type is <b>Primitive</b>. Cells with a <b>Hexagonal</b> system and a
primitive <b>P</b> lattice (corresponding to all the other space groups from 143
to 194 that are not R) are always represented using full hexagonal prismas, when
the chosen type is <b>Conventional</b>, and one-third of the hexagonal prismas,
when the chosen type is <b>Primitive</b>.

<h3>N1, N2, N3</h3>

Change the number of cells to replicate, in the three directions of space, 
when the chosen type is <b>Conventional</b>, <b>Primitive</b> 
or <b>Wigner-Seitz</b>. When not needed, these parameters are disabled.

<h3>V1, V2, V3, V23, V13, V12</h3>

A <b>Parallelepiped</b> filtering volume is defined by three edge 
lengths, <b>V1</b>, <b>V2</b>, <b>V3</b>, plus the three angles between 
them, <b>V23</b>, <b>V13</b>, <b>V12</b>. Each angle must be smaller 
than the sum of the other two and must be larger than the absolute 
difference of the other two, otherwise an error is produced.

<p/>

A <b>Sphere</b> filtering volume is defined by the radius <b>v1</b>.
When not needed, these parameters are disabled.

<p/>

All nodes inside the volume representation are allocated (even if the
user choosed to hide them). In <b>Parallelepiped</b> and <b>Sphere</b> 
volumes, a small tolerance (by default 1.0E-4) is added around the volume 
space to make sure that nodes in the borders are included. For example, 
a sphere with <b>v1</b> = <b>1.0</b>, filtering a cubic primitive lattice 
with <b>a</b> = <b>1.0</b>, allocates 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 nodes (without 
the tolerance, the result could be undefined).
