Define here the projection parameters applied by default when creating a new layer.

<h3>Perspective, Orthographic</h3>

Set the projection that is applied by default when creating a new layer. 

GAMGI projects the 3D layer space on the 2D screen using <b>Perspective</b>
or <b>Orthographic</b> projections. The <b>Perspective</b> projection
is better to simulate realistic views, but the <b>Orthographic</b>
projection preserves object dimensions, as these are not distorted
by perspective.

<h3>Near, Far, Top</h3>

Set the dimensions of the space volume that by default 
is visible to the observer, after being projected into the 
window graphic area.

<p/>

This projection volume has six faces, and the front and back faces 
are always perpendicular to the viewing direction. <b>Near</b> and
<b>Far</b> set the default distances from the observer to these front 
and back faces, corresponding to the minimum and maximum distances 
that the observer can see. <b>Near</b> must be smaller than <b>Far</b>.

<p/>

In a <b>Orthographic</b> projection, the projection volume is a rectangular
parallelepiped, so the 4 lateral faces are paralell and perpendicular to
each other. In a <b>Perspective</b> projection, the projection volume is
a truncated quandrangular pyramid, with the apex at the view point.

<p/>

<b>Top</b> defines the half-height of the front face of the projection 
volume. The width is automatically determined from the ratio height / width 
of the window graphic area, so everytime users resize this window, the 
projection volume changes accordingly. Increasing <b>Top</b> increases 
the visible volume and decreases the size of the objects.

<p/>

Each layer has its own projection parameters, so in a window with
multiple visible layers, the image rendered in the graphic area 
is the superposition of the various, totally independent, layer 
views.
