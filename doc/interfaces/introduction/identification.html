Every object in GAMGI is identified by a name and a number.

<h3>Name</h3>

Names are used to allow users to identify the objects. Although GAMGI always 
checks them for correctness and consistency, names are not used internally, 
for identification purposes or others. Names are totally controlled by users: 
if they wish, GAMGI can generate default names for new objects, but only users 
can change names after that.

<p/>

Names can have a maximum of 20 characters and each character can be a letter 
(<b>a-z</b> and <b>A-Z</b>), a number (<b>0-9</b>) or any of the following 
characters: <b>( ) [ ] { } &lt; > _ . + -</b>.
Some of these characters are particularly usefull to name coordination compounds
and charged species, for example,

<p/>

Although names can start with any of these characters, it might be good 
practise to start names with a letter, for compatibility with other programs.

<h3>Number</h3>

Numbers are used to allow GAMGI to identify the objects. Objects of different classes 
may have the same number, but objects of the same class must have different numbers. 

<p/>

Numbers are totally controlled by GAMGI: they are generated, modified and removed by GAMGI, 
without any user intervention. Although numbers can be quite useful for users, its meaning 
is often unclear, due to the recycling mechanisms that GAMGI applies: i) numbers are 
recycled when objects are removed and may reappear later attached to new objects; 
ii) when recovering with undo/save techniques, new numbers will be attached to 
the recovered objects.

<p/>

Any positive integer is a valid identification number. When recycled numbers are available, 
GAMGI reapplies them in the order they are listed. Otherwise, GAMGI applys new numbers in
increasing order.
