These are medium and long-term projects, regarding
technical topics, that we aim to implement futurely.

<h3>Implementation of gamgi_engine_malloc and gamgi_engine_free</h3>
For the sake of code control, independence and maintenance,
GAMGI uses only pure AINSI C code for everything, except the
graphics code, which uses only standard OpenGL calls (no Mesa 
specific calls) and the user interface code that uses Glib/GDK/GTK
calls. In particular, GAMGI uses only AINSI C in its inner engine,
which means malloc and free.

<p/>

To improve memory management efficiency, avoiding to allocate
many times small amounts of memory, which may waste time doing 
these slow memory operations and produce unused chunks of memory,
it would be important to allocate memory for several objects of
each kind at once, keep them in a stack, when the stack is empty
create more objects, usually the double, when the objects are freed,
put them back in the stack, etc...

<p/>

<h3>Definition and implementation of a GAMGI scripting language</h3>
Every single command handled by dialog windows and mouse actions
should be emulated using only a command line scripting language.

<p/>

This is important, because it will allow us to describe entire
working sessions in log files, so loading those files we will be able
to recreate all the work done before, and changing the log files will 
allow us to automatically create different working sessions.

<h3>Implementation of GAMGI multi-tasking infrastructure</h3>
In the future GAMGI must allow users to do more
than one operation at a time. This is important
when an operation takes too long to complete, 
and in animation, for example.

<p/>

The solution is probably to use threads instead of multi-processes 
or other multitasking techniques, but that must be carefully analysed first.

<h3>Documentation available in Latex format</h3>
Producing good documentation explaining not just how things
work but also why they work that way should always rank high 
in the list of priorities of any self-respecting computer package. 

For a project run by volunteers, as GAMGI, this is even more critical, 
because commercial books are generally not available and programmers 
tend to prefer writing code than documentation. We believe
that lack of documentation is a serious bug in a program and 
major efforts should be done to avoid it. 

<p/>

GAMGI documentation is currently available only in XHTML
format. We should have at least Latex and PS versions,
created from a single master, using some of the free
format converters currently available, in various stages 
of development. Moreover, the documentation development and
format translation could be controlled by makefiles, 
exactly as code.

<h3>GAMGI internationalization</h3>
GAMGI is currently an english-only program. Although GAMGI is
primarily a scientific tool, it can also be used to great advantage
to teach and attract interest for such matters as chemistry, physics, 
materials science, geology, etc. However, many of the potential students
have only a marginal knowledge of the english language and it would
be a shame it they couldn't use GAMGI due to their poor english 
proficiency.

<p/>

There are two ways to handle this problem:
<ol>
<li>To prepare and maintain different GAMGI versions, 
one for each language.</li>
<li>To prepare and maintain a single GAMGI version, 
with menu-driven options to allow the user to choose on-the-fly 
which language to apply.</li>
</ol>

<p/>

The first option is much easier, because different languages require 
different space and even orientation (for example in arabic) to give
the same information, and it is therefore tremendously difficult to prepare 
dialog windows that fit all languages at once. For western-languages we
could probably go with the second, more elegant solution, but for Chinese,
Japanese, Arabic, etc. we feel that the first solution might be the most
sensible.

<p/>

To support non-western languages, such as Chinese, Japanese and Arabic,
GAMGI must understand Unicode, the international standard to represent
characters for any kind of live or dead language. Unicode functionality 
has been implemented by PANGO, a free GPL library, which will be used in
GAMGI to represent all characters that are not described by the
good old 7-bit ASCII standard.
