<h1>Bond Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">

<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove a bond (or list of bonds, previously         
selected with Bond->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the bond and all 
its contents is removed. This is the default.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the bond is removed but
its contents (orbitals, texts) is saved, linked to the first atom parent. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the bond is preserved 
but all its contents (orbitals, texts) is removed. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Orbital</b> or <b>Text</b>,
these objects are removed from the bond.

<p/>

When the removed bond was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over a bond in the current layer, its identification
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
To recover the previous state press <b>Undo</b>.
