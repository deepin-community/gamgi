GAMGI source code is in the <b>src</b> directory, distributed over the 
sub-directories <b>engine</b>, <b>gtk</b>, <b>mesa</b>, <b>math</b>, 
<b>chem</b>, <b>phys</b>, <b>io</b>, <b>expat</b> and <b>global</b>. 
The code in the <b>gtk</b> directory (TODO) is in turn partially distributed 
over sub-directories <b>text</b>, <b>atom</b>, <b>bond</b>, <b>light</b>, 
<b>layer</b>, etc., one for each object class.

<p/>

Each directory has a makefile, listing all the local source files.
These makefiles are then included in the global makefiles, in the 
<b>src</b> directory.

<p/>

Each directory has a common header <b>.h</b> file, containing 
all the relevant type definitions, enumerations, macros, plus library 
headers that are relevant for that section of the code. This information
should be included in the common header files only (library headers 
which are needed only once, are included directly in that specific 
source file, to reduce compilation time). The common header files
are then included in the <b>.c</b> source files everytime that
information is needed.
  
<p/>

Every <b>.c</b> file has a corresponding <b>.h</b> file, containing:
1) full declarations (including argument names) of all the functions 
in the source file, including local (commented) functions; 2) a rationale
describing the mains aspects of the control flow. Local functions are 
classified as <b>static</b> and start with the prefix <b>static_</b>. 
Global functions start with the name of the file containing them. 

<p/>

All files start with the prefix <b>gamgi_</b> and for each directory
in the file path after the <b>src</b> directory a new prefix is added, 
with the name of the directory. Thus a file (and the external functions
inside) in the directory <b>src/engine</b> must have a prefix <b>gamgi_engine</b>.
With this naming conventions it is easy to: 1) distinguish static and 
external Gamgi functions; 2) distinguish Gamgi and library functions; 
3) to identify where is the file that contains a given Gamgi external 
function.
  
<p/>

To understand GAMGI control flow, the first file to check
is <b>/src/global/gamgi_global_main.c</b>, where GAMGI
starts and ends. To understand GAMGI data flow, the first file
to check is <b>/src/engine/gamgi_engine.h</b>, which
contains the primary data types and definitions.

<p/>

GAMGI has one global variable, called <b>gamgi</b>, declared in 
<b>gamgi_global.h</b>. This header file is then included everytime 
<b>gamgi</b> is needed. This declaration is actually redundant, 
as the <b>gamgi</b> address (TODO) can be acessed as the parent 
object for all the windows objects, but it makes code slightly 
simpler.
