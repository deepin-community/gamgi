Define here the maximum and step parameters 
controlling the ruler (in the tools menu).

<h3>Rotate</h3>

<b>Max</b> sets the range of angle values accepted by the ruler, 
to rotate objects. Clicking on the ruler extreme left, the 
object is rotated by <b>-Max</b>. Clicking on the ruler 
extreme right, the object is rotated by <b>Max</b>. 
<b>Max</b> must be positive.

<p/>

The rotation angle applied to the object, when clicking on the
ruler, increases from the extreme left to the extreme right 
(from <b>-Max</b> to <b>+Max</b>), in a step by step way. 
The width of each step, starting from the center to the extremes, 
is defined by <b>Step</b>.

<p/>

For example, when <b>Step</b> is set to <b>Max</b>,
only two angles are recognized: <b>-Max</b> on the left
(negative) side and <b>+Max</b> on the right (positive)
side of the ruler. When <b>Step</b> is 0, the angle
changes continuously from one extreme to the other.

<p/>

<b>Step</b> cannot exceed <b>Max</b>, otherwise the extreme 
values would never be reached (the central value is always 0).

<h3>Move</h3>

<b>Max</b> sets the range of length values accepted by the ruler,
to move objects. Clicking on the ruler extreme left, the
object is moved by <b>-Max</b>. Clicking on the ruler
extreme right, the object is moved by <b>Max</b>.
<b>Max</b> must be positive.

<p/>

The translation length applied to the object, when clicking on 
the ruler, increases from the extreme left to the extreme right
(from <b>-Max</b> to <b>+Max</b>), in a step by step way.
The width of each step, starting from the center to the extremes,
is defined by <b>Step</b>.

<p/>

For example, when <b>Step</b> is set to <b>Max</b>,
only two lengths are recognized: <b>-Max</b> on the left
(negative) side and <b>+Max</b> on the right (positive)
side of the ruler. When <b>Step</b> is 0, the length
changes continuously from one extreme to the other.

<p/>

<b>Step</b> cannot exceed <b>Max</b>, otherwise the extreme
values would never be reached (the central value is always 0).

<h3>Scale</h3>

<b>Max</b> sets the range of factor values accepted by the ruler,
to scale objects. Clicking on the ruler extreme left, the object 
is scaled by <b>1 / Max</b>. Clicking on the ruler extreme right, 
the object is scaled by <b>Max</b>. <b>Max</b> must be larger than 1.

<p/>

For example, when <b>Step</b> is set to <b>Max - 1</b>,
only two factors are recognized: <b>1 / Max</b> on the left
side and <b>Max</b> on the right side of the ruler. When
<b>Step</b> is 0, the factor changes continuously
from one extreme to the other.

<p/>

<b>Step</b> cannot exceed <b>Max - 1</b>, otherwise the extreme 
values would never be reached (the central value is always 1).
