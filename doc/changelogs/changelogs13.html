<div>GAMGI 0.14</div><div>23rd September 2009</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Added 9 geometry and 9 topology properties to the report
produced by Group->Create in Polytope mode. Implemented
and tested Group->Modify for Polytopes, including transitions
in Autonomy and type of polytope: polyhedron, plane, direction.
Added Help documentation for Group->Create, Group->Modify,
Atom->Create, Atom->Modify. Fixed bugs. New screenshot.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Enough testing... this is it, GAMGI 0.14!</li>
<li>Fixed a few error handling issues in Group->Modify and Group->Create.</li>
<li>Moved parent initialization from gamgi_engine_copy_out.c to
gamgi_engine_copy.c, so copy_out functions can be used elsewhere
without erasing parent information.</li>
<li>Group->Modify is working fine in Autonomy mode: All -> None.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify: origin 
and euler were not initialized, before entering the new values.</li>
<li>Group->Modify is working fine in these Autonomy transitions:
None -> None, None -> All and All -> All. All -> None is not working yet.
Partial Autonomy is not going to be supported soon.</li>
<li>Position and orientation is working for Group->Create
for all cases, and for Group->Modify when Autonomy is NONE.</li>
<li>Further improvements in Group->Modify: GUI, behaviour.</li>
<li>Group->Modify is working, except position and orientation.</li>
<li>Improved the Group->Modify interface and behaviour.</li>
<li>Found and temporarily fixed a bug (disabled autonomy option for 
planes, directions coming from polytope code): currently atomic planes
and directions created from Group->Create cannot support all the functionality
available from Plane->Create or Direction->Create (due to single inheritance, 
exactly as Group->Create). These planes, directions can then be easily
modified, including Autonomy, with Plane->Modify or Direction->Modify.</li>
<li>Modified the way gamgi_chem_polytope and gamgi_gtk_group_create
transfer data, so it works also for gamgi_gtk_group_modify.</li>
<li>Fixed two bugs in polytope code: Scale was not updated and
color was wrong in one case when creating planes or directions.</li>
<li>Created a YBa2Cu3O7 screenshot showing 2D and 3D polytopes.</li>
<li>Group->Create Polytope is now reporting 9 geometry properties:
polyhedron volumes, areas, lengths and aberrations, face areas,
lengths and aberrations, edge lengths and angles.</li>
and edge lengths.</li>
<li>Added Help->Current and Help->Topic support for Group->Create->Polytope
and Group->Modify->Polytope. Previously this was available only for 
Group->Create and Group->Modify.</li>
<li>Found and removed a Group->Create bug: the current action
was GROUP_CREATE but it should be GROUP_CREATE_POLYTOPE.</li>
<li>Group->Create Polytope is now reporting 9 topology properties:
number of polyhedrons, faces, edges and vertices, number of faces,
edges and vertices per polyhedron, number of edges|vertices per edge,
number of faces|edges per vertex.</li>
<li>The Web, Help->Current and Help->Topic are now reading the new 
documentation for Atom->Modify, Atom->Config, Group->Create, 
Group->Modify.</li>
<li>Updated documentation for dialog Atom->Config.</li>
<li>Increased CSS notebook ul width to 60em to avoid tag wrapping
in Atom->Modify.</li>
<li>Updated documentation for the new dialog Group->Modify.</li>
<li>Updated documentation for the new dialog Atom->Modify.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in polytope code: the central atom color 
should be used, not the color for the central atom element.</li>
<li>Wrote documentation for the new dialog Group->Create.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Replace GtkFileSelection by GtkFileChooserWidget.</li>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Add plane area and direction length to Plane->Measure and
Direction->Measure.</li>

<div>GAMGI 0.13.15</div><div>10th August 2009</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Designed, implemented and tested a new algorithm to merge coplanar
faces in 3D polytopes. Tolerance for visible and coplanar polytope
faces in now controled by users in Group->Create. Improved layout
for Atom->Create and Atom->Modify interfaces. Replaced a wide range 
of GTK 1 deprecated functions by new GTK 2 routines. Fixed a few 
drawing bugs.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Tolerance for visible and coplanar faces is now defined
directly by users (including disabling face merging).</li>
<li>Fixed for Groups the bug previously found for Clusters related
with different scaling for Container and Polytope types.</li>
<li>The new algorithm to merge coplanar faces is working fine, 
even with rather complex examples, with 50,000 atoms!</li>
<li>Implemented a new algorithm to merge coplanar faces in 3D polytopes.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug: Cluster objects of Container and Polytope
types must be scaled in different ways. This problem applies also to 
Group, Molecule and Association objects.<li>
<li>Removed the polytope code to merge coplanar faces, as this is plagued 
to raise lots of problems due to finite floating point numerical precision. 
Merging faces will be done only in the end, after the polytope calculation,
a much more solid solution.</li>
<li>Profiled the polytope code with 50,000 atoms in a cube and on a sphere:
we got exactly the same results (3.000000 and 79.000000 sec, respectively) 
with or without speedups. Therefore removed speedups, to simplify the code 
and make it less error prone.</li>
<li>Improved the View page layout, in Atom->Create and Atom->Modify dialogs.</li>
<li>The rendering thickness for Cell and Group wired objects is different: fixed.</li>
<li>Found a bug related with half-bonds in Atom->Modify.</li>
<li>Removed first and second GTK_OBJECT casts in g_signal_connect_swaped 
calls.</li>
<li>Removed GTK_OBJECT cast in g_signal_connect_after calls.</li>
<li>Clarified a problem and filled a bug report for Gnome MetaCity related
with gtk_window_set_transient and fullscreen mode that afects Gamgi.</li>
<li>Replaced deprecated GTK function: gtk_menu_append. Except in old 
files gamgi_gtk_file_export.c and gamgi_gtk_file_import.c, that will be
replaced soon, no GTK deprecated functions are now used in Gamgi.</li>
<li>Removed option_menu widgets and fixed g_object_get_data labels
in static_rotation_ok in gamgi_gtk_cell_align.c. When converting to GTK 2
combo boxes, this was left unfinished, so Gamgi would crash immediately
when attempting to align a Cell with the Layer or another Cell.</li>
<li>Replaced deprecated GTK function: gtk_window_set_policy.</li>
<li>Replaced GTK 1 progress by GTK 2 progress bar widget.</li>
<li>Replaced deprecated GTK functions: gtk_notebook_set_homogeneous_tabs,
gtk_notebook_set_page, gtk_signal_handler_block_by_func and
gtk_signal_handler_unblock_by_func.</li>
<li>Improved make_rules, following the suggestions of Daniel Leidert, 
from the Debichem group, packaging Gamgi for the Debian distribution.</li>
<li>Prepared
<a href="http://www.gamgi.org/screenshots/screenshots14.html">
screenshots</a> showing the new polytope code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Replace GtkFileSelection by GtkFileChooserWidget.</li>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Add plane area and direction length to Plane->Measure and
Direction->Measure.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>

<div>GAMGI 0.13.14</div><div>15th July 2009</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Fixed a couple of bugs in chem and gtk code, including a nasty
brown paper bag that crashed the new polytope code in many systems.
Everything that can be measured with Atom->Measure can now be modified
with the new Atom->Modify dialog. The oldest dialog in Gamgi, Group->Modify,
has been replaced by an entirely different dialog, to modify Groups, 
including polytopes.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added bond cleaning when creating Polytopes and improved this
cleaning for Planes and Directions.</li>
<li>Improved layout for View page in Atom->Create and Atom->Modify.
Variancy is now a combo box entry, with 0.0 and 1.0 sugestions.</li>
<li>Improved layout for View page in Bond->Modify and Atom->Modify.</li>
<li>Fixed position for Autonomy combo box in Plane->Modify and 
Direction->Modify dialogs.</li>
<li>Completed interface behaviour in Group->Modify dialog.</li>
<li>Improved Scale behaviour in Group->Modify,
Plane->Modify, Direction->Modify dialogs.</li>
<li>Replaced Property by Quantity in Plane->Measure and
Direction->Measure dialogs.</li>
<li>Designed and implemented the new Group->Modify dialog.</li>
<li>Modifying atom-2atom distances is now working fine.
All the quantities that can be measured with Atom->Measure
can now be modified with the new dialog Atom->Modify.</li>
<li>Modifying atom-direction distances is now working fine.</li>
<li>Modifying atom-3atom distances is now working fine.</li>
<li>Modifying atom-plane distances is now working fine for all cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a old bug when modifying a torsion angle: the terminal
branches of the second atom should change as well, not just the
first atom and its terminal branches.</li>
<li>The only task dialog in GAMGI still from the first generation,
Group->Modify, has been removed. It will be replaced soon 
by a dialog handling Polytopes, among other things.</li>
<li>All the functionality previously available in Group->Modify
is now available in Atom->Modify, in the mode Geometry.</li>
<li>Completed all the GTK code for the new Atom->Modify dialog.</li>
<li>The new Atom->Modify dialog will be used to set all the quantities 
that are measured in Atom->Measure, replacing the old Group->Modify dialog 
that will be used to modify Group objects such as polytopes.</li>
<li>The new Atom->Modify dialog is almost finished:
removed a sync bug resulting in a GTK warning.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in gamgi_chem_geometry.c:
sequence array off limits by 1, for bond angles.</li>
<li>Removed all warnings at -O3 compilation level, on Fedora 9.</li>
<li>Found and removed a crashing bug in gamgi_chem_polytope.c:
in static_vertex_create, first total should not be there.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in gamgi_gtk_atom_modify.c:
when style changes, update draw, not atom->draw.</li>
<li>Designed the new Group->Modify dialog: based on Atom->Measure
and Group->Create, the first page has radio buttons to jump 
between the two sets of pages (Atoms and Polytope). Opens initially
in one of the two sets (Atoms), in the second page, to preserve
a rule always followed in GAMGI GUIs: users are required to fill 
only the starting visible notebook page, all the others are optional 
or have suitable defaults.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Complete the 3D polytope code, including documentation.</li>
<li>Replace GtkFileSelection by GtkFileChooserWidget.</li>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>

<div>GAMGI 0.13.13</div><div>13th May 2009</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Improved, tested, cleaned the polytope code and redesigned the way data 
is stored to increase maintenance and readibility. Added speedups to make
the code more efficient. This code builds a 3D convex hull for 50,000 atoms
under 3 seconds on my desktop system. Moved the corresponding graphic interface 
from Cell->Link to Group->Create. Added new options (Autonomy) and defaults 
(color, neighbour elements, number of neighbours). Removed (GTK 1) GTK_OBJECT 
casts for all g_signal_connect calls.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Removed the GTK_OBJECT () cast (from GTK 1) in g_signal_connect 
calls, in all src/*/*c and src/*/*/*c files (but not in 
g_signal_connect_after and g_signal_connect_swapped calls).</li>
<li>Removed Polytope code from Cell->Link (this is now in Group->Create).</li>
<li>In the polytope code, added error checks to see if: 1) the selected 
atom is outside the current object selection; 2) Global mode is wrongly 
used with unrestricted neighbour distance.</li>
<li>Added parameter autonomy to Group objects, as in Planes
and Directions. Autonomy All and None are now working fine
for Groups created by the Polytope code.</li>
<li>When building polytopes, use central atom default color, 
when neighbour element is undefined and default neighbour 
color cannot be used.</li>
<li>The central atom is now added, in first place, to new 1d-, 
2d- and 3d- polytopes, just before the neighbour atoms.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in the polytope code: each new Group object 
should belong to the first parent above the corresponding central Atom
that is at least a Group object, not to the current selection.</li>
<li>Redesigned the interface for Group->Create: it looks clean and
functional now.</li>
<li>The polytope code is now available from Group->Create.</li>
<li>The polytope code is now working fine for a cube with 50,000 atoms!
(screenshot soon...). It looks fast also (about 2-3 seconds on my 
2 year old system).</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in the speedup code.</li>
<li>Added speedup code to accelerate search for conflicts and edges
in arrays.</li>
<li>Debugged polytope code with new data structures.</li>
<li>Changed policy for types and macros: from now on, these will be local
when usage is local, instead of being defined in global headers, as before.</li>
<li>Redesigned data structures for faces, edges and vertices in polytope code.
The new structures are much easier to maintain and understand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite Group->Modify, to include Polytopes and upgraded
Atoms mode.</li>
<li>Complete the 3D polytope code, including documentation.</li>
<li>Replace GtkFileSelection by GtkFileChooserWidget.</li>
<li>Rewrite the About dialog, in the notebook form, to
include pages for Developers, Contributors, Supporters.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Add plane area and direction length to Plane->Measure and
Direction->Measure.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
<li>Improve selection dialogs, including list selection methods.</li>

</div>

<div class="contents">

The polytope code seems to be working fine now, in 1D (automatically producing 
a range of atomic directions), 2D ((automatically producing a range of atomic 
planes) and 3D conditions (automatically producing a range of polyhedra atomic
groups). In the last case, the array-based (for speed) 3D convex hull incremental 
algorithm, with conflict lists, is still operating with restrictions (the code to 
handle and merge coplanar faces is still switched off). Moreover, no documentation 
is currently avalable. The code is temporarily available from Cell->Link and 
then Link Polytope (though we plan to move it to Group->Create instead). This 
functionality is very important to describe crystallographic structures such 
as minerals, superconductors, etc. but also to analyse glasses, liquids, etc.
We are now getting close to GAMGI 0.14.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The planar polytope code, building atomic planes, is working.</li>
<li>The linear polytope code, building atomic directions, is working.</li>
<li>The topology arrays (faces, edges, vertices) should be replaced
by structures containing arrays, to improve maintenance.</li>
<li>Testing the polytope code: seems to be working fine!</li>
<li>Decreasing tolerance to 1.0E-10 fixed numerical problems with the 
incremental algorithm in the polytope code (coplanar code switched off).</li>
<li>the same conflict might be retrieved from both faces around the visible 
edge: we have now a simple solution to this bug: use a unique identifier 
everytime we get conflicts for a new face.</li>
<li>Solved the realloc bugs due to outdated array memory addresses.</li>
<li>Debugging the core polytope code (currently without coplanar faces) 
is doing good progress.</li>
<li>Simplified the code handling the initial polytope.</li>
<li>Simplified,reviewed the polytope code handling faces,vertices arrays.</li>
<li>Completed and tested the polytope code related with conflict lists.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Complete the 3D polytope code, including documentation.</li>
<li>Replace GtkFileSelection by GtkFileChooserWidget.</li>
<li>Add a task id to operactions involving multiple scans to
guarantee that there is no flag corruption when bonds are
created between different molecules.</li>

All the GTK 1 menus have now been replaced by GTK 2 Combo boxes.
Wrote the GTK interface (currently only in Cell->Link) to build
3D and 2D polytopes around central atoms. Improved polytope code 
and wrote the remaining sampling code needed to get polytope neighbours. 
Debugged and tested all the polytope sampling, starting, exporting code, 
except the core incremental algorithm code. Fixed a bug in the XML code 
importing crystallographic directions with centered nodes.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Improved static_group and static_cluster in gamgi_io_x3d.c</li>
<li>Updated gamgi_mesa_scan and gamgi_io_x3d for group objects.</li>
<li>The polytope code is now building the initial tetrahedron for
all central atoms. All users options are working fine, including lights.</li>
<li>Centering polytope groups is now working fine (rotations, scaling).</li>
<li>The code building the initial tetrahedron, for the polytope incremental 
algorithm, is working fine. The final exporting code is also working fine.</li>
<li>The default color for Planes and Directions (in XML, GTK interfaces),
can now be configured from GAMGI XML files.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in the gamgi_expat_import_object.c: o4 node
coordinates were not properly imported for Directions, resulting in a error.</li>
<li>Inverted the distance-ordered neihbours, so farthest atoms are added
first in the polytope incremental algorithm, thus potentially removing 
closer atoms and decreasing the number of expensive polyhedra recalculations.</li>
<li>Simplified the polytope code: removed array xyz (using array neighbours 
instead), removed routines static_visible, static_coplanar, static_mix, 
static_valid_tetrahedron (using new routine static_mix instead),
removed variable t_neighbours (using n_vertices instead).</li>
<li>Wrote the polytope code to build the initial tetrahedron, 
orientated counter-clockwise.</li>
<li>Fixed a name conflict between Random and Polytope Link methods.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when measuring notebook size: in some cases, this size 
is given by tag size. Solution: hide tags when measuring size.</li>
<li>Added View (Style, Color) parameters to Polytope Cell->Link interface.</li>
<li>The routines to create,reset,free topology arrays in the polytope code 
are running fine.</li>
<li>The routines to scan neighbours in the polytope code are now working fine.</li>
<li>Wrote all the (cell based) scanning code needed to find the closest 
neighbours for each central atom in the polytope building code.</li>
<li>Implemented a dialog to build arbitrary polytopes from Cell->Link dialogs.</li>
<li>Converted the last GTK 1 Option Menus (Cell Type) in Cell Create

<div class="contents">

Fixed a few copyright issues raised by the Debian legal team.
This release includes most of the code needed to implement
a fast, sophisticated 3D convex hull incremental algorithm. 
This is array-based (to be faster), with arrays of cell lists 
(to speed up sampling), conflict lists (to be NlogN), can handle 
coplanar issues, arbitrarily large faces, periodic boundary conditions, 
etc. It will be useful to describe arbitrary sets of arbitrary polyhedra
defined by atoms, such as in superconductors, silicates, glasses, etc.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Wrote, cleaned, redesigned segments of the 3D convex hull code.</li>
<li>Finnished most of the (3D convex hull) code to build arbitrary 
polytopes.</li>
<li>Updated the Group object, to receive the new polytope 
functionality.</li>
<li>Redesigned the new chemical polytope code.</li>
<li>Morten Kjeldgaard (Ubuntu) pointed my attention to GL2PS: 
an OpenGL to PostScript printing library. This looks very,
very interesting for the future.</li>
<li>Improved the Postscript header. GAMGI now understands 
and accepts both .ps and .eps name extensions.</li>
<li>Fixed the legal issues regarding Mark Kilgard's 
green book code. Many thanks to Mark Kilgard, for 
clarifying the issues raised by  Michael Banck.</li>
<li>Anonymous ftp.gamgi.org is working fine again.</li>
<li>Fixed the legal copyrights and notices in gamgi_io_file
and gamgi_mesa_area covering Mark Kilgard's code explained
in the book: OpenGL programming for the X Window System.</li>
<li>Fixed the legal copyrights and notices in gamgi_mesa_text
and gamgi_io_x3d_render files covering OGLFT and GLE libraries.
Thanks to Morten Kjeldgaard (Ubuntu) and Michael Banck (Debian) 
for raising these issues.</li>
<li>Moved www.gamgi.org to a new computer. Everything is working
fine except anonymous ftp. Hopefully this will be back soon.</li>
<li>The hard core of the array-based 3D convex hull algorithm, with 
conflict lists and coplanar handling, is now in place, but has not 
been tested yet.</li>
<li>Started implementing a fast (NlogN) 3D convex hull algorithm, (using
arrays to be faster, as in the Voronoi code). This will allow users to
generate arbitrary polytopes with GAMGI. This is particularly useful in
Crystallography (silicates, superconductors, etc.) to represent tetrahedrons, 
octahedrons, etc. A 2D convex hull algorithm has been already implemented 
in order to describe polygonal planes.</li>

This release merges all the X3D (the new XML version of VRML) code developed by 
Tiago Farto, after extensive cleaning. This includes code to describe all the objects 
currently supported by GAMGI, as layers, cells, clusters, molecules, groups, planes, 
directions, atoms, bonds and texts. As X3D handles a single 3D space (while GAMGI 
handles multiple 3D spaces through layers), only objects in the current layer 
are exported, the other layers are ignored.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cleaned and tested cylinder bonds code in static_bond in gamgi_io_x3d.c.</li>
<li>Cleaned and tested line bonds code in static_bond in gamgi_io_x3d.c.</li>
<li>Cleaned gamgi_io_x3d.c: static_scale, static_unscale, static_text, 
static_orbital, static_atom, static_direction, static_plane, static_group,
static_molecule, static_cluster, static_cell, static_assembly, static_layer.</li>
<li>Merged all the X3D (the new XML version of VRML) code developed by Tiago Farto,
after cleaning (files gamgi_io_x3d.c and gamgi_io_x3d_render.c.). This includes code 
to describe all the objects currently supported by GAMGI, as layers, cells, clusters, 
molecules, groups, planes, directions, atoms, bonds and texts. Thanks Tiago, for this
very nice work!.</li>
<li>Replaced h_addr by h_addr_list[0] in gamgi_io_socket.c, as suggested by
Morten Kjeldgaard (Ubuntu), as h_addr has been deprecated in version 2.8 of 
libc6, that will be used in Ubuntu 8.10. Thanks Morten!.</li>
<li>Removed file dat/cell/polymers/polyethylene_sulfide.cif, that 
is not used at all by GAMGI and cannot be distributed, from both my 
latest distribution and GAMGI 0.13.8, released a few weeks ago.
Thanks to Morten Kjeldgaard (Ubuntu), for noticing this.</li>
</ul>

<div class="contents">

This is a bug fix release. Several new and old bugs, simple but puzzling 
and affecting productivity, were clarified and removed. Converted Cell 
Align option menus (Gtk 1) to combo boxes (Gtk 2).

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a simple but old and relevant bug in the Expat code:
conventional axes were exported when they should be primitive.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with Gtk 2.0 code: the window bottom bar 
must be hidden after showing the window, otherwise this does 
not work properly when coming from XML files.</li>
<li>Replaced all the GTK 1 option menus in gamgi_gtk_cell_align 
by GTK 2 combo boxes and cleaned the code.</li>
<li>Fixed a Gtk warning in Atom->Config: Charge entry is not there.</li>
<li>Changed sligthly the mass, radius, charge defaults policy: all atoms
must now have valid mass, radius, charge. For Dummy atoms the default
mass and radius is 1.0. Elements without a known radius get radius from 
the lower element that has one. For all elements default charge is 0.0</li>
<li>Reorganized all the atomic mass, radius, color data in Gamgi: 
all this data is now stored in arrays in gamgi_chem_property.c.</li>
<li>Synced mass, radius atomic defaults with the new mass, radius data.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in Gtk code: when pressing with the mouse on the ruler 
and move,rotate,scale mode was off, garbage messages would show up.</li>
<li>Fixed the mathematical algorithm to solve systems of two linear
Diophantine equations: we were missing some solutions because we were 
not taking into account all the infinite intermediate solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Replace GtkFileSelection by GtkFileChooserWidget.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Add plane area and direction length to Plane->Measure and
Direction->Measure.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
<li>Improve selection dialogs, including list selection methods.</li>
<li>Implement multiple object picking, including a
dynamic frame with moving ants and dragging anchors,
to select multiple objects and images from the screen.</li>

<div>GAMGI 0.13.7</div><div>8th July 2008</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Added mass data for most important isotopes, including isotope abundance and 
half-life (source: wikipedia). Added radius data including natural half-distances, 
effective and calculated atomic radius, effective and calculated (2008) covalent

the new (2008) calculated covalent radius, available for Z <= 96.</li>
<li>Updated effective and calculated atomic radius data, from 
<a href="http://www.webelements.com/">WebElements</a>.</li>
<li>The complete ionic Shannon (1976) radius are now fully working on Gamgi.</li>
<li>The atomic radius information for all elements, including half-distance in
natural state, atomic effective, atomic calculated, covalent and Van der Waals
radius, is now working.</li>
<li>The isotopic information for all elements, including isotope abundance, 
half-life and excited states, is now working.</li>
<li>Replaced the option menu (GTK 1) Scope, in Cell->Remove, by
a combo box (GTK 2).</li>
<li>Added a new size, GAMGI_ENGINE_STRING, currently 50, for pair values.</li>
<li>Replaced option menu (GTK 1) Borders, in Object->Measure dialogs by
combo box (GTK 2).</li>
<li>Added main introduction file main.html to Help->Current.</li>

<li>The XML Cell parameter "o_vectors" is now "origin_vectors".</li>
<li>In Cell->Create and Cell->Modify, improved the Origin page interface 
and behaviour.</li>
<li>Replaced option menus (GTK 1) origin vectors, axes, axes vectors,
in Cell->Create and Cell->Modify by combo boxes (GTK 2).</li>
<li>In Gtk Combo Boxes, the renderer should be added AFTER the
tree store. In Gtk Tree Views the renderer should be added BEFORE
the tree store. All Combo Boxes and Tree Views now follow this rule.</li>
<li>Replaced o4 option menus (GTK 1) by combo boxes (GTK 2) in
Cell->Create, Cell->Modify.</li>
<li>Replaced o4 option menus (GTK 1) by combo boxes (GTK 2) in 
Plane->Create, Plane->Modify, Direction->Create, Direction->Modify.</li>
<li>Fixed a little offset bug when handling the reference combo box in 
Direction->Modify, in static_autonomy (introduced in GAMGI 0.13.5).</li>
<li>Updated the make_local file: the default configuration should work fine 
for Fedora 8.0, Ubunty 7.10, Suse 10.3, Mandriva 2008 on xf86 machines. The 
commented configuration for the same distributions on amd64 is exactly the
same, except lib is replaced everywhere by lib64.</li>
<li>Updated the users mailling list address in Help->Start.</li>
<li>Added second level dialogs to show atomic mass, radius and charge,
from Atom->Create, Atom->Config and Atom->Config.</li>
<li>We have now clear ideias on how to implement general, powerful polytopes
in GAMGI to describe atomic structures. Each polytope will be created as an
independent Group object, from Group->Link, Molecule->Link, Cluster->Link 
or Cell->Link, entering the number of neighbours or the desired neighbour 
shell thickness. Each procedure will create just one or all the equivalent 
polytopes. From the math point of view, an incremental algorithm, with 
conflicting information, a O(n) algorithm, will be used to calculate the 
arbitrarily complex 3D convex hulls we need to build.</li>
</ul>

Ported GAMGI to GTK 2.0/GTKGLext 1.0. Apart from very minor details everything seems to be working fine. This was essential to guarantee the GAMGI future. Some widgets still need to be replaced but the main issues are solved. Added a man page, images for icons, instructions for distributions. Fixed light, plane, direction bugs.

gtk_entry_get_text commands, to avoid warnings.</li>
<li>Commented all gtk_widget_set_usize commands, to compile.</li>
<li>Started a new development branch, to move GAMGI to 
GTK 2. Updated the make_rules file accordingly.</.li>
<li>Found and removed a light bug: exporting shininess with 2 decimal 
figures resulted in parameter loss. Increased to 4 decimal figures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Redesign Atom->Create and Atom->Modify, according with the new
notebook style, with more properties, including a wide range of atomic
radius.</li>
<li>Add a bond angle, which is useful to control double bonds
in solid mode.</li>
<li>Add plane area and direction length to Plane->Measure and
Direction->Measure.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>
<li>Replace set/get_data functions by structures
defined in gtk/gamgi_object.h headers.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
<li>Improve selection dialogs, including list selection methods.</li>
<li>Implement multiple object picking, including a
dynamic frame with moving ants and dragging anchors,
to select multiple objects and images from the screen.</li>

<div>GAMGI 0.13.1</div><div>14th February 2008</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Analysed, cleaned, removed all issues generating warnings when compiling
with -O3 added to default gcc -g -Wall -ansi, in both xf86 and xf86_64
architectures, with gcc 3.3.4 (Suse 10.0) and gcc 4.1.2 (Fedora 8),
plus pointer_to_int and int_to_pointer conversions in non-32 bit
machines. Found and removed 4 actual bugs in the process.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cleaned array addressing in gamgi_phys_wigner (static_orthorhombic_c, 
static_orthorhombic_f, static_orthorhombic_i_high, static_orthorhombic_i_low,
static_rhombohedral_high and static_rhombohedral_low).</li>
<li>gcc 4.1.2 on xf86_64: cleaned all issues generating warnings 
when compiling with -O3 added to default gcc -g -Wall -ansi.</li>
<li>gcc 4.1.2 on xf86_64: cleaned all int-to-pointer and pointer-to-int
conversions generating warnings in chem/ and expat/ code when compiling 
with default gcc -g -Wall -ansi.</li>
<li>gcc 4.1.2 on xf86_64: cleaned all int-to-pointer and pointer-to-int
conversions generating warnings in mesa/ code when compiling with default
gcc -g -Wall -ansi.</li>
<li>gcc 4.1.2 on xf86_64: cleaned all int-to-pointer and pointer-to-int 
conversions generating warnings in gtk/ code when compiling with default 
gcc -g -Wall -ansi.</li>
<li>gcc 4.1.2 on xf86_64: cleaned all int-to-pointer and pointer-to-int 
conversions generating warnings in engine/ code when compiling with default 
gcc -g -Wall -ansi. These conversions are now handled by properly designed 
macros, which are also easily found with grep.</li>
<li>gcc 3.3.4 on xf86: cleaned all issues in phys/ code generating warnings 
when compiling with -O3 added to default gcc -g -Wall -ansi.</li>
<li>gcc 3.3.4 on xf86: cleaned all issues in gtk/ code generating warnings when 
compiling (gcc 3.3.4 on xf86) with -O3 added to default gcc -g -Wall -ansi (one 
real bug found in gamgi_gtk_cell_modify.c: one truely missing initialization).</li>
<li>gcc 3.3.4 on xf86: cleaned all issues in chem/ code generating warnings when 
compiling with -O3 added to default gcc -g -Wall -ansi (two real bugs found in 
gamgi_chem_symmetry.c: one truely missing initialization and two code lines 
wrongly exchanged).</li>
<li>gcc 3.3.4 on xf86: cleaned all issues in math/ and mesa/ code generating 
warnings when compiling with -O3 added to default gcc -g -Wall -ansi.</li>
<li>gcc 3.3.4 on xf86: cleaned all issues in engine/ and expat/ code generating 
warnings when compiling with -O3 added to default gcc -g -Wall -ansi (one real 
bug found in gamgi_expat_import_object.c: a variable depending on the order of 
function argument handling, which is implementation dependent).</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<li>Redesign Atom->Create and Atom->Modify, according with the new
notebook style, with more properties, including a wide range of atomic
radius.</li>

<li>Add plane area and direction length to Plane->Measure and 
Direction->Measure.</li>
<li>Write tutorials about crystalographic and atomic Plane,Direction usage.</li>
<li>Port GAMGI to GTK 2.* or (3.*).</li>
<li>Replace set/get_data functions by structures
defined in gtk/gamgi_object.h headers.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
