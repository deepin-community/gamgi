Set here the atomic structure to include, and the range
of planes to create, for a given crystallographic family.

<h3>Structure</h3>

It is often useful to recreate in a plane the atomic
structure existing in the parent object. A list is first
created, with all the atoms closer to the plane than
the distance defined by <b>Thickness</b>.

<p/>

When <b>Structure</b> is set to <b>Copy</b>, listed atoms
are copied to the atomic or crystallographic planes just created.

When <b>Structure</b> is set to <b>Link</b>, listed atoms
are linked to the atomic or crystallographic planes just created.

When <b>Structure</b> is set to <b>None</b>, only a polygonal
representation of the plane is created, without atoms.

<h3>Filter</h3>

After collecting a list of atoms close enough to the plane,
a filtering condition may be applied. This can be very useful
to avoid atom superposition, resulting for example from atoms
copied before to different planes.

<p/>

When <b>Filter</b> is set to <b>Class</b>,
atoms belonging to another planes are ignored.

When <b>Filter</b> is set to <b>Child</b>, atoms not
belonging directly to the plane parent are ignored.

When <b>Filter</b> is set to <b>Identical</b>, atoms
closer than a given distance (currently <b>1.0E-2</b>,
as defined in <b>GAMGI_MATH_TOLERANCE_STRUCTURE</b>) to
a previous atom are ignored.

When <b>Filter</b> is set to <b>None</b>, no filtering
condition is applied.

<h3>Thickness</h3>

The polygonal representation of a plane is expanded as much as 
possible, limited by the cell volume, in crystallographic planes, 
and by the atoms within a <b>Thickness</b> range of the plane 
defined by the three atoms, in atomic planes.

<h3>Range</h3>

A crystallographic plane does not exist as a single plane, is always
part of a family of infinite planes, passing through all the lattice 
nodes, with equal distances between them. Each plane of a family 
(h k l) intersects the lattice in n/h n/k n/l, where n = 0 means 
the plane passing through the origin and n = 1 is the usual 
representation of the plane closest to the origin.

<p/>

The range of planes to create is defined by the values entered near to 
the buttons <b>Start</b> and <b>End</b>, describing the initial and final 
values of n. For example, setting <b>Start</b> to <b>-1</b> and <b>End</b> 
to <b>1</b> creates 3 planes, intersecting the axes in: 1) -1/h -1/k -1/l; 
2) 0; 3) 1/h 1/k 1/l. By default, only the nearest plane to the origin is 
considered: <b>Start</b> = <b>1</b> and <b>End</b> = <b>1</b>.

<p/>

Pressing the <b>Start</b> button, the entry is disabled and GAMGI creates 
automatically all the planes from the beginning of the cell volume to the 
final plane specified. Pressing the <b>End</b> button, the entry is disabled
and GAMGI creates automatically all the planes from the end of the cell volume 
to the first plane specified. When both buttons are pressed, GAMGI creates
automatically all the planes from the beginning to the end of the cell volume.

<h3>Node</h3>

A plane can also be defined indicating explicitly the coordinates of 
a node where the plane passes. For each plane family, there is a plane 
passing through the origin node and as nodes are equivalent, it follows 
that for any node, there is a plane of any family passing through there. 
To select the node, press <b>Node</b>, to open a second level dialog.

<h3>o1, o2, o3</h3>

These entries provide the coordinates of the node in the lower-left
corner of the cell where the plane passes, calculated with conventional
or primitive cell vectors. When the lattice is primitive or vectors are
primitive, this corner node becomes the place where the plane passes.

<h3>o4</h3>

When the lattice is centered and vectors are conventional, a fourth 
coordinate <b>o4</b> is needed to point the centered node where the 
plane passes. By default, <b>o4</b> is <b>000</b>, so no change is 
introduced. When the cell lattice is primitive <b>P</b> or the vectors 
defining the node are primitive, that is the only possible value for 
<b>o4</b>. For I, C, F, R centered lattices, <b>o4</b> can also take 
the values:

<pre>
<b>I</b>: <b>111</b>
<b>C</b>: <b>110</b>
<b>F</b>: <b>110</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>011</b>
<b>R</b>: <b>211</b>, <b>122</b>
</pre>

corresponding to the numerators of the inner node coordinates,
(1/2 1/2 1/2) for <b>I</b> lattices, (1/2 1/2 0) for <b>C</b>
lattices, (0 1/2 1/2) (1/2 0 1/2) (1/2 1/2 0) for <b>F</b>
lattices and (1/3 2/3 2/3) (2/3 1/3 1/3) for <b>R</b> lattices.

<p/>

After entering the node coordinates, pressing <b>Ok</b> saves the data,
closes the second level dialog, and disables the range information in
the first level dialog. Pressing <b>Cancel</b>, the current data in
both dialogs is maintained and the second level dialog is closed.

<p/>

Pressing <b>Range</b> in the first level dialog, removes the second 
level data, closes the second level dialog, enables and initializes 
(if empty) the range data.

<p/>

The vectors used for the node coordinates, <b>Conventional</b>
or <b>Primitive</b>, are those used to define the plane indices,
in the <b>Type</b> page, of the first dialog.

<p/>

When adding information in the second level dialog, the cell must
have been entered before, so GAMGI can check if the node information is
correct or not. For the same reason, when the <b>Cell</b> or <b>Vectors</b>
information in the <b>Type</b> page is changed, all the information in the
second level dialog is automatically discarded, as it might be wrong.
