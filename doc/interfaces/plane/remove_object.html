<h1>Plane Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">
<ul>
<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove a plane (or list of planes, previously         
selected with Plane->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the plane and all 
its contents is removed. This is the default.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the plane is removed but
its contents (directions, atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) is saved, 
linked to the plane parent. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the plane is preserved but 
all its contents (directions, atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) is removed. 
Atomic planes are removed because they cannot live without the defining
atoms.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>direction</b>, <b>atom</b>, <b>bond</b>, 
<b>orbital</b> or <b>text</b>, these objects are removed from the plane.
When an atom used to define an atomic plane is removed, the plane is 
automatically removed.

<p/>

When the removed plane was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over a plane in the current layer, its identification 
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
To recover the previous state press <b>Undo</b>.
