Copyright: Copyright (C) 1967 Allen V. Hershey
License: other
 The Hershey fonts in this file were taken from the GNU package
 plotutils, that includes the arrays _occidental_hershey_glyphs[] and
 _oriental_hershey_glyphs[]. The first array includes the standard
 (`occidental') Hershey glyphs digitized by Dr. Allen V. Hershey, some
 glyphs due to other people, and his Japanese Hiragana and Katakana
 glyphs. The second array includes his digitizations of Japanese
 ideographic symbols (Kanji glyphs).  It originally included the Hiragana
 and Katakana glyphs as well, but they were moved to the first array
 because some people may not wish to include Kanji support.
 .
 Dr. Hershey digitized the glyphs c. 1967, at what is now the U.S. Naval
 Surface Weapons Center in Dahlgren, Virginia.  For many years he
 distributed copies of the glyphs, and his typographic software, on
 magnetic tape.  Over 120 copies of the tape were distributed.  There
 have been many other distributions of the glyphs.  In the 1970's they
 were incorporated, not always with attribution, in several commercial
 plotting packages.  They were first freely distributed in 1985(?), by
 being posted to Usenet (to vol. 4 of mod.sources) by Pete Holzmann
 <pete@xc.org>, then at Octopus Enterprises.  In the 1980's the glyphs
 were incorporated in at least two freeware plotting programs, Nelson
 Beebe's PLOT79 and Tim Pearson's PGPLOT. The latter is still available
 (see http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/).
 .
 The _occidental_hershey_glyphs[] array was constructed from
 releases of the Hershey glyphs that are later than the one described in
 the 1976 NBS publication above. For example, Fig. 15 of that work
 portrays 43 additional glyphs digitized by Norman Wolcott of the NBS;
 they are included here.  See the file ./doc/hershey-number for details
 on how the array was assembled.  The original Hershey glyphs, including
 the 43 Wolcott glyphs, are stored in the 0..3999 slots of the array.
 .
 The _occidental_hershey_glyphs[] array also includes non-Hershey glyphs
 taken from various sources.  All post-Hershey glyphs have been placed in
 slots 4000..4194.  This includes a few glyphs taken from the UGS (the
 Unified Graphics System, developed by Bob Beach at SLAC; see Computer
 Graphics, Fall 1974, pp. 22-23).  As well, it includes some freeware
 glyphs developed by Thomas Wolff <wolff@inf.fu-berlin.de> and
 distributed as part of the Ghostscript distribution.  The Beach and
 Wolff glyphs are used in the Hershey Symbol fonts.  Locally developed
 glyphs (accented characters, in particular) have been added too.
 .
 The Japanese Hiragana and Katakana glyphs digitized by Dr. Hershey,
 formerly located among the `oriental' glyphs, are now located in slots
 4195..4399 of the _occidental_hershey_glyphs[] array.
 .
 The format of the glyphs in the _occidental_hershey_glyphs[] and
 _oriental_hershey_glyphs[] arrays is the format in which the Hershey
 glyphs were distributed to mod.sources in 1985(?) by Pete Holzmann, and
 is due to Jim Hurt, then at Cognition Inc.
 .
 The standard hardcopy reference for the occidental Hershey glyphs, which
 tabulates and displays them, is:
