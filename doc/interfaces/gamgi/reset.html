<div class="contents">

<b>Gamgi->Reset</b> asks confirmation to restart GAMGI.

<p/>

Because this is a very sensitive operation, users are not allowed 
to perform any other task until answering the question (not even 
consulting the <b>Help</b>).

<p/>

Pressing <b>Ok</b>, GAMGI removes all the objects, cleans the history archives, 
exits all the actions that were taking place and keeps only a single empty window, 
as in the beginning.

<p/>

However GAMGI does not reset the configuration information, so for example, 
changes in atom default properties and bond length limits, introduced by the 
user, are still valid after <b>Gamgi->Reset</b>.
