<b>Molecule->Select</b> selects a molecule or a list of molecules.

<p/>

To select an molecule click the mouse over its visual representation:
if GAMGI recognizes the molecule it becomes the new selected
object, otherwise the mouse action is ignored.

<p/>

When an object is selected, a beep is emitted and the object 
identification is shown in the window status bar, first in a       
highlighted color (to emphasize that the current object has 
changed) and then in the default color (after a few seconds).

<p/>

Only molecules in the working layer can be selected, even if
molecules are visible in other (transparent or translucid) layers.
For each top window, only one selected object is maintained. This
can be Gamgi (everything), Window (the current window), Layer (the current
layer), or a child object of the current layer. To see which
object is currently selected see its identification in the window
statusbar.

<p/>

<b>Molecule->Select</b> shows a flat list of all molecules currently
existent in GAMGI, not necessarily in the same layer or window.
For each molecule, a hierarchical tree shows all its child objects.
