Building GAMGI is trivial, _as_long_as_ all libraries
can be seen at compile time, link time and run time.
If problems arise, see the <a href="tips.html">tips</a> section.

<p/>

Most Linux distributions split libraries in two packages,
one containing the (shared object) *.so files, with a name such as
library-version.rpm, and another containing the (header) .h files, 
usually with a name such as library-version-devel.rpm. To run GAMGI 
only the former are necessary, but to compile GAMGI all are required.

<p/>

Popular Linux distributions tend to install library-version.rpm 
but not library-version-devel.rpm packages, to save space, assuming
that users want to run but not to build the applications. Smaller
libraries as Expat, GtkGLext and Freetype tend to include *.so
and *.h files in a single package. All these libraries are available 
from every Linux distribution, so finding and installing 
library-version.rpm and library-version-devel.rpm is easy.

<h3>Go to the source code directory</h3>
<pre>
<b>cd $GAMGI/gamgi_version/src</b>
</pre>

<h3>Edit the file make_local</h3>
When installing GAMGI for the first time, edit the file 
<b>$GAMGI/gamgi_version/src/make_local</b> and update the following 
lines, which tell <b>gcc</b> and <b>make</b> where are the required 
header (<b>.h</b>) and library (<b>.so</b>) files (when updating 
the GAMGI version, just copy this file from a previous installation):

<pre><b>
PATH_EXPAT_H = -I/usr/include
PATH_FREETYPE_H = -I/usr/include/freetype2
PATH_X_H = -I/usr/X11R6/include
PATH_GLIB_H = -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib64/glib-2.0/include
PATH_CAIRO_H = -I/usr/include/cairo
PATH_PANGO_H = -I/usr/include/pango-1.0
PATH_ATK_H = -I/usr/include/atk-1.0
PATH_GTK_H =  -I/usr/include/gtk-2.0 -I/usr/lib64/gtk-2.0/include
PATH_MESA_H = -I/usr/include
PATH_GTKGL_H = -I/usr/include/gtkglext-1.0 -I/usr/lib64/gtkglext-1.0/include

PATH_EXPAT_L = -L/usr/lib64
PATH_FREETYPE_L = -L/usr/lib64
PATH_X_L = -L/usr/X11R6/lib64
PATH_GLIB_L = -L/usr/lib64
PATH_CAIRO_L = -L/usr/lib64
PATH_PANGO_L = -L/usr/lib64
PATH_ATK_L = -L/usr/lib64
PATH_GTK_L =  -L/usr/lib64
PATH_MESA_L = -L/usr/lib64
PATH_GTKGL_L =-L/usr/lib64
</b></pre>

This is a typical configuration for most Linux distributions on amd64
(for i386 and PPC hardware replace lib64 by lib). Slightly different 
configurations, for several different distributions and architectures 
are available from the same file.

<h3>Build the executable</h3>
To build the gamgi executable, type <b>make</b>.
To remove object and executable files, type <b>make clean</b>.
