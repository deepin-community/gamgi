Change here the volume representation for a single orbital or a list of orbitals.

<p/>

To modify an orbital, click over its graphic image, or write its id on
the <b>Orbital</b> entry. To modify a list of orbitals, press the button
<b>List</b> (after creating the list of orbitals with <b>Orbital->Select</b>).
Parameters for empty entries or <b>Local</b> choices remain unchanged.

<p/>

To change an orbital name write the new name in the <b>Orbital</b> entry,
followed by the orbital number (GAMGI needs the number to identify the orbital).
To change the name for a list of orbitals, press <b>List</b> first
and then write the new common name in the <b>Name</b> entry.

<h3>Phase</h3>

When <b>Phase</b> is switched on (the default), the orbital is
represented with two colors, to distinguish places where the wave
function is positive and negative. When <b>Phase</b> is switched off,
the whole orbital is represented with just one color.

<h3>Frame</h3>

When <b>Frame</b> is switched on (the default), a cubic frame
is shown around the orbital, with a edge length equal to twice
the sampling <b>Radius</b> defined in the <b>Model</b> page.
When <b>Frame</b> is switched off, no frame is shown.

<h3>Octants</h3>

Often it is useful to show only parts of the orbital.
In GAMGI each orbital is divided in 8 octants, four above
the xy plane, marked as positive, and four below, marked
as negative. The four octants, above and below, are numbered
increasing in a counter-clockwise pattern, as usual in trigonometry.
To set which orbital octants should be represented,
switch on / off each of the eight octant buttons.
By default all octants are shown.

<h3>Axes</h3>

When <b>Axes</b> is set to <b>Radius</b>, axes are shown
with the radius length (when <b>Frame</b> is disabled) or
the diameter length (when <b>Frame</b> is enabled). When
<b>Axes</b> is set to <b>Bohr</b>, axes are shown with
the length of Bohr first radius. When <b>Axes</b> is set
to <b>Unit</b>, axes are shown with a unit length. When
<b>Axes</b> is set to <b>None</b>, no axes are shown
(the default).

<p/>

When <b>Frame</b> is enabled (the default), axes are positioned
along the frame edges, starting from the xyz lower corner. When
<b>Frame</b> is disabled, axes start from the orbital center.

<p/>

The options <b>Bohr</b> and <b>Unit</b> are useful only for
small orbitals, otherwise the axes are barely visible.
