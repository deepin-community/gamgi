Set here the translation vector applied to each light or
list of lights linked to a layer. Directional lights have
no position, so <b>Shift</b> does not affect them.

<p/>

When linking a light to another layer, the translation
is always applied to the light itself. Directional lights
have no position, so <b>Shift</b> does not affect them.

<p/>

The final light position is given by this translation vector added
to the current light position, as defined by the <b>Reference</b> option.
By default this is the light position and the translation vector is
<b>0.0</b>, <b>0.0</b>, <b>0.0</b>, so no translation is applied.

<p/>

When a list of lights is linked, <b>Reference</b> is set by default
to <b>Child</b>, so lights preserve their positions and are not superposed.
