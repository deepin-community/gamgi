A really useful package must be easy to obtain, 
to compile, to use and to change, giving users 
and developers as much control as possible. This 
means: 

<p/>

1) Designing an elegant and flexible architecture
for the whole package, including hidden resources
as the memory and graphic engines, and visible 
mechanisms as the graphical user interface. This
is particularly important in a package that
aims to be used in scientific research, where
the required functionality is quickly changing
and the capacity to adapt to new demands
is critical.

<p/>

2) Writing simple, well documented code. 
We put great emphasis in the quality of 
the code that we write, because:
i) it is open source, so everyone can judge
our work (thanks for the fish!); ii) writing
beatiful code is an important incentive to
continue the project; iii) simple, clean, code
is easier to understand and maintain, thus
atracting more developers to the project and 
increasing its probabilities of long term sucess.

<p/>

3) Using standards and reducing code dependencies
as much as possible. We use only ANSI C code in GAMGI,
so gcc could be replaced by any other C compiler.
We don't use Mesa-specific functions, so Mesa
could be replaced by any other OpenGL implementation.
We use Gtk only to write GUI-specific code, so Gtk could
be replaced, without much pain, by any other X toolkit 
library. We plan to use only the most common Python/Perl 
functions in filters to convert file formats, this way 
making it easier for non-Python/Perl mongers to understand 
and change the scripts.

<p/>

4) Reducing as much as possible the number
of libraries the package depends on, particularly
those more difficult to install, less maintained
and more susceptible to changes.

This helps to reduce the wall between users and programs,
encouraging them to compile and modify the source 
code, instead of just using black-box executables.
Writing a few hundred lines of code to avoid depending
of a library is not reinventing the wheel, but to
increase freedom for users and developers.

<p/>

5) Building the package in a way as simple and 
transparent as possible. Using config, make,
make install is simple, when it works, but makes
it completely impossible to understand what is 
actually occurring. The GAMGI makefiles are designed
to be powerfull (permiting for example to compile
several executables at the same time, in different
directories, with different functionality) yet
small and transparent to the user, making it simple
to understand the logic and mechanisms used by
gcc and make to build GAMGI.

<p/>

6) writing insightfull documentation for both
users and developers, not just explaining how
things work, but also why they work that way.

The first and most important line of defense
to have a user-friendly package is to design it
well, but in complex, comprehensive pachages,
that is usually not enough, we need good manuals,
where information is clear and can be found quickly.

Before being software developers, we are software
users, so we really understand the frustration
that most users feel when they use software today,
as usually manuals either don't exist, are useless
or are considered as non-essential products, that
users are invited to get and pay separately.

We are commited to provide good documentation
not just for users that want only to know how
to do their job, but also to developers, who
need to understand how GAMGI works, before they
can change or improve its functionality.

<p/>

Above all, we believe that for users and developers
alike, the ultimate goal is technological control,
and the key to achieve it is simplicity.
