<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove an orbital (or list of orbitals, previously         
selected with Orbital->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the orbital and all 
its contents is removed. This is the default.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the orbital is removed but
its contents (child texts) is saved, linked to the orbital parent. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the orbital is preserved 
but all its contents (child texts) is removed. 

<p/>

When the removed orbital was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over an orbital in the current layer, its identification
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
To recover the previous state press <b>Undo</b>.
