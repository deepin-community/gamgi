Indicate here the number of layer copies to create and its destination.

<p/>

Gamgi expects users to identify first the layer or list of layers to copy.
When the <b>Layer</b> entry is active and empty, clicking the mouse over
the window graphic area creates a menu with all the window layers (local
selection), which can then be selected. The current layer is initially proposed
in the <b>Layer</b> entry. Pressing the <b>List</b> button, the current list
of layers is selected instead.

<h3>Name</h3>

This is the name given to the new layer copies. The
default is to copy the name of each original layer.

<h3>Number</h3>

This is the requested number of copies, a positive integer.
The default is 1.

<h3>Window</h3>

After identifying the layer or list of layers to copy, GAMGI expects
users to identify a window to where the layers should be copied. Pressing
the mouse over a graphic area in any window (global selection), creates
a menu with all the top windows, which can then be selected.
The current window is initially proposed in the <b>Window</b> entry.

<p/>

When copying a list of layers, the copies can also be created at the
window of each original layer, by setting <b>Window</b> to <b>Local</b>.
