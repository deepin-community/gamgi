The GAMGI project believes that pure software (not related with any hardware
device) should be governed only by the general laws of copyright, as any piece
of written text, and therefore should not be subjected to the industrial
restrictions and commercial rules of patent law.

<p/>

It seems dificult to argue that a totally original written text, that is not
an illegal (or unethical) copy of some other work, should be forbidden on the
grounds that its general purpose, the goal that it aims to achieve, is not original.
The same rule applied to book writting would turn most works written recently
in easy preys to legal ransom.

<p/>

The GAMGI project signed recently a license
<a href="http://www.gamgi.org/project/gamgi_oin_agreement.pdf">
agreement</a> with <a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">
OIN</a>, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Invention_Network">
company</a> created by industry heavy weights to raise a pool
of patents large enough to discourage legal threats against
Linux related software.
