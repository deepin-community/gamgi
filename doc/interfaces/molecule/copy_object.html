Indicate here the number of molecule copies to create and its destination.

<p/>

Gamgi expects users to identify first the molecule or list of molecules to copy.
When the <b>Molecule</b> entry is active and empty, clicking the mouse over
an molecule, on the current layer (local selection), its identification is
transported to the <b>Molecule</b> entry. Pressing the <b>List</b> button,
the current list of molecules is selected instead.

<h3>Name</h3>

This is the name given to the new molecule copies. The
default is to copy the name of each original molecule.

<h3>Number</h3>

This is the requested number of copies, a positive integer.
The default is 1.

<h3>Layer</h3>

After identifying the molecule or list of molecules to copy, GAMGI expects
users to identify a layer to where the molecules should be copied. Pressing
the mouse over the graphic area in any window (global selection), creates
a menu with all the layers in that window, which can then be selected.
The current layer is initially proposed in the <b>Layer</b> entry.

<p/>

When copying a list of molecules, the copies can also be created at the
layer of each original molecule, by setting <b>Layer</b> to <b>Local</b>.
