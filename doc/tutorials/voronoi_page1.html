Voronoi tesselation is used in a wide range of scientific areas,
from medicine to economics, as a technique to split some intensive 
quantity among a given set of objects. When these are atoms, the 
Voronoi tesselation provides a way to relate the electronic distribution 
of the atomic structure with its topologigal and geometric properties.

<p/>

First we create a water molecule and calculate its Voronoi
tesselation, changing the boundary offset, the boundary conditions,
and the atomic weights. The four polyhedra obtained can be seen 
in the figure at

<h3>Water</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Press <b>Atom->Create</b>, set <b>Element</b> to <b>O</b>,
set <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> to <b>0</b>, <b>0</b>, <b>0</b>,
and press <b>Ok</b>, to create the O atom.</li>

<li>Set <b>Element</b> to <b>H</b>, set <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> to
<b>0.6</b>, <b>0.7749</b>, <b>0</b>, and press <b>Ok</b>,
to create the first H atom. To create the second, set <b>Element</b> to
<b>H</b>, and <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> to <b>0.6</b>, <b>-0.7749</b>,
<b>0</b>, before pressing <b>Ok</b>.</li>

<li>Select <b>Molecule->Create</b>, write a name for the molecule, 
for example <b>water</b>, and press <b>Ok</b>. The new molecule has no
contents yet, so the dialog <b>Molecule->Link</b> replaces automatically
the previous one. Press the mouse over one of the atoms and press
<b>Ok</b>, to link it to the molecule. Repeat for the other two atoms.</li>

<li>Select <b>Bond->Create</b> and click over the <b>O</b> and a
<b>H</b> atom to create a bond. Repeat with the other <b>H</b> atom.
To see the object hierarchy, select for example <b>Molecule->Select</b>.
To save the molecule, press <b>File->Export</b> and write the file name,
for example <b>water.xml</b>, before pressing <b>Ok</b>.
</li>

<li>Select <b>Molecule->Measure</b>, set <b>Method</b> to <b>Voronoi</b>,
and click on the molecule. A polyhedra cluster object is shown, in a new 
layer (with <b>Visibility</b> to the <b>Outside</b> set to <b>None</b>), 
describing the tesselation of the water molecule. A long report is also 
produced, with geometrical and topological properties. To see what 
these properties mean press <b>Help->Current</b>. Close the report window,
rotate the cluster and move it to the top right corner of the graphic area.</li>

<li>Select <b>Layer->Select</b> (or press <b>Layer</b> on the top menu
with the mouse middle button) and click the mouse on the screen, to list
the available layers and select the first one, that contains the water 
molecule. The water and the cluster are now both visible (because this 
layer has <b>Visibility</b> to the <b>Outside</b> set to <b>All</b>).</li>

<li>Select again <b>Molecule->Measure</b>, set <b>Method</b> to <b>Voronoi</b>,
but this time change <b>Offset</b> to <b>0.1</b> (<b>Voronoi</b> page), 
before clicking on the molecule. The 6 outside planes are now much closer 
to the atoms, so the cluster produced is much smaller and its shape is 
also different. Rotate the cluster and move it to the bottom right corner 
of the graphic area.</li>

<li>Select again the layer containing the water molecule. Select again
<b>Molecule->Measure</b>, set <b>Method</b> to <b>Voronoi</b> but this time
change <b>Boundaries</b> to <b>Periodic</b> (<b>Voronoi</b> page), before 
clicking on the molecule. Instead of defining 6 outer planes, the water 
molecule was now surrounded by 26 virtual copies of its own, and the cluster 
obtained reflects these changes.</li>

<li>Select <b>Cluster->Copy</b>, change <b>Number</b> to <b>2</b>, click 
on the cluster and press <b>Ok</b>, to produce two new copies of the original 
cluster. Select <b>Cluster->Select</b> and confirm that there are now three
clusters exactly equal. Then click on the visible cluster to select it and
move it to the right until it just touches the central one. Click again on 
the visible cluster to select it and move it to the left until it just 
touches the central one. The three clusters together define a continuous 
pattern, showing that periodic boundary conditions were applied. Select 
<b>Cluster->Remove</b> and click on the left and right clusters to remove 
them. Move the remaining cluster to the top left corner of the graphic area.
</li>

<li>Select again the layer containing the water molecule. Select again
<b>Molecule->Measure</b>, set <b>Method</b> to <b>Voronoi</b>,
<b>Boundaries</b> to <b>Periodic</b> but this time change <b>Variancy</b> 
to <b>1.0</b> (<b>Voronoi</b> page), before clicking on the molecule. 
This time larger atoms have larger polyhedra so these are much smaller 
for H than for O. Move the cluster to the bottom left corner of the graphic 
area and select again the layer containing the water molecule, to see the 
four polyhedra obtained so far.</li>
