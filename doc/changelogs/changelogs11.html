<div>GAMGI 0.12</div><div>24th September 2006</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Completed the code to build arbitrary ranges of crystallographic 
directions belonging to the same family. Planes and directions 
can now be created passing through a given node or between planes 
with a given order. Improved the code to measure lengths between 
planes, directions and atoms. Planes and directions with any order 
or node can now be exported and imported to XML GAMGI format. 
Removed some numerical bugs, mainly in the code to build directions. 

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed some links and added images that were missing
in the users documentation.</li>
<li>Distances between atoms and atomic planes can now
be calculated, for independent and independent planes.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in gamgi_chem_symmetry.c:
in static_try_m0, negative d[n] components could produce
wrong results.</li>
<li>Distances between atoms and planes (points) in
reciprocal space are now calculated. Previously we calculated
the distance to the plane passing through the origin.</li>
<li>Distances between independent directions and atoms 
are now properly calculated. Updated this calculation for
projected directions.</li>
<li>Simplified the code to obtain a rotated and translated 
point, without using the object center.</li>
<li>Distances between directions and atoms are now properly
calculated, for directions not going through the cell origin
(this was already done for planes).</li>
<li>The direction node position is now imported, 
as o1,o2,o3,o4 parameters.</li>
<li>Added random pictures to www.gamgi.org front page.</li>
<li>Directions now maintain the node coordinates in primitive
or conventional vectors, the vectors defined for the indices.</li>
<li>The direction node position is now exported, as o1,o2,o3,o4 
parameters.</li>
<li>The object name in planes and directions was always exported, 
even when it was the default: fixed.</li>
<li>A old, deprecated, visibility XML parameter (none) was still 
exported instead of the new one (no): fixed.</li>
<li>Improved the way crystallographic planes 
and directions are tested throughout the code.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug, in the code to build directions
in ranges: a variable was not properly initialized in static_segment, 
in gamgi_phys_direction.c, resulting in crashes when points were 
too close.</li>
<li>When defining direction ranges, plane indices too small
(multiple planes) are allowed, but plane indices too large
(Lauer planes) are not (because the conversion makes no sense).</li>
<li>Multiple indices are not allowed for directions, but they
are allowed for planes (Laue reflections).</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug, in the code to build directions in ranges: 
some directions were not created due to numerical errors, when the plane 
was tangent to the cell. The third point needed to define a plane 
is now chosen in such a way that the section of the plane inside 
the cell is maximized, eliminating the problem.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in the procedure to create directions
in cell volumes: the routine to create 3 orthogonal points was broken.
</li>
<li>The procedure to create ranges of crystallographic
directions from two family planes in the direction zone
is working fine.</li>
<li>Crystallographic planes can now be created specifying either
a range of orders or a specific node on the plane.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify functionality.</li>
<li>Replace set/get_data functions by structures
defined in gtk/gamgi_object.h headers.</li>
<li>Add Object->Copy dialogs with basic copy functionality.</li>
<li>Add Contents and Container options in Object->Remove dialogs.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
<li>Implement global selection, including global picking
algorithms and selection dialogs that include all the
selection methods.</li>
<li>Implement multiple object picking, including a
dynamic frame with moving ants and dragging anchors,
to select multiple objects and images from the screen.</li>
</ul>

Atomic planes and directions can now be created in any
atomic container object, and the planes and directions
can be taken away, as independent objects, with all the 
atoms and bonds inside. Wrote the second level and

<div class="contents">

Reorganized the crystallographic plane and direction code.
Crystallographic planes and directions can now be automatic
or independent objects. Crystallographic families of planes 
can now be generated for a given range, including the whole 
cell volume. Independent crystallographic planes can now 
include automatically all the atoms within a given thickness.
Redesigned the frontpage and improved the styling of www.gamgi.org.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plane polygons are now illuminated from both sides,
using glLightModeli (GL_LIGHT_MODEL_TWO_SIDE, GL_TRUE).</li>
<li>Independent crystallographic planes can now include 
automatically all the atoms within a given thickness.
This is quite usefull for crystalline structure analysis.</li>
<li>gamgi_gtk_direction_create.c is now importing the new
direction data: 2 atom identifiers, automatic/independent,
thickness, start and end order, scale. Thickness and direction
order is not working yet though.</li>
<li>Spam against the lists is increasing. All mail going from 
non members to GAMGI lists is now automatically discarded. 
Before it was kept for aproval.</li>
<li>gamgi_gtk_plane_create.c is now importing the new
plane data: 3 atom identifiers, automatic/independent, 
thickness, start and end order, scale. Apart from atomic 
planes and thickness everything else is now working.</li>
<li>Cleaned the code to build directions, in 
gamgi_phys_direction.c and gamgi_math_polygon.c.</li>
<li>Fixed a little bug in direction rendering code: the line
width was different in gamgi_mesa_draw.c and gamgi_mesa_scan.c.</li>
<li>Independent directions now can be rotated, translated and scaled
on their own. Automatic directions rotate, translate and scale
the immediate parent above.</li>
<li>The plane-atom distance for polygonal planes of any order 
is now correctly measured.</li>
<li>Independent planes now can be rotated, translated and scaled
on their own. Automatic planes rotate, translate and scale
the immediate parent above.</li>
<li>Whole ranges of crystallographic planes belonging to the 
same family can now be created automatically.</li>
<li>A order parameter can now be used in XML files to
indicate which plane in the family should be considered.</li>
<li>Planes in direct space, intersecting the cell axes 
in (n/h, n/k, n/l) can now be represented for any value of n.
Before, only n = 1, the usual default, was possible.</li>
<li>Code related with planes and directions is now 
in gamgi_phys_plane.c and gamgi_phys_direction.c, respectively.
Moved code to get plane and directions vectors to these files.
Cleaned code in gamgi_phys_plane.c and gamgi_phys_direction.c</li>

<div class="contents">

Moved everything in gamgi.org, except Documentation->Interfaces
and the frontpage, to new XHTML and CSS styles, with simpler markup 
and much heavier use of CSS. Notebook and Menu pure CSS pages are now 
used. Double and triple bonds are now properly represented in both 
Wired and Solid modes. With few modifications (C,Si,Na...), the 
default color scheme used by Gabedit for atomic elements has been 
adopted (resulting in a much more colorful Periodic Table).

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Moved Documentation Tutorials to the new tab-based style.</li>
<li>Apart from the Reference Manual for Interfaces, 
everything in www.gamgi.org should have been upgraded by 
now to the new XHTML and CSS, including Documentation.</li>
<li>Improved double and triple solid bond design, which is
closer to chemical reality. These bonds are also rendered 
with pre-compiled lists now.</li>
<li>Gabedit has a periodic table with default colors for all elements 
GAMGI is now using this color scheme, with a few modifications 
(C green, Si yellow, Na blue, N lighter blue, S lighetr yellow).</li>
<li>Double and triple bonds are now represented as double
and triple lines in solid mode.</li>
<li>Double and triple bonds are now represented as double
and triple lines in wired mode.</li>
<li>Updated documentation in www.gamgi.org: Description, 
Installation, Code, Manuals, Bibliography, etc. Tested CSS 
and XHTML validity.</li>
<li>Started moving www.gamgi.org to new code, with simpler XHTML
markup, better CSS and more elegant and intuitive interfaces
for users. As a result, remote help support might be temporarily 
unreliable.</li>
<li>Successfuly compiled Gamgi on Intel-based 64 bits computers 
running Suse Linux 10.0 x86_64. Added the configuration to make_local.

<div class="contents">

Removed a couple of showstopper bugs affecting Cell->Create and 
Cell->Modify. The Random Close Packing is now fully working in 
Cell->Link. Global object linking is completed, though it is only 
implemented so far in Cell->Link. Fixed size settings were removed 
from all GAMGI dialogs, so changing fonts should be fine now.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Completed global object linking, in gamgi_gtk_object_link.c,
seems to be working fine. Implemented only in Cell->Link so far. 
Apart from objects with special needs (Atoms, Planes, Directions) 
it will be trivial to extend this to all the other objects.</li>
<li>Improved documentation: installation requirements.</li>
<li>Upgraded for the latest Mesa 6.4.2 (solves a light bug),
Freetype 2.1.10 and Expat 2.0.0 releases. Everything seems
to be working fine.</li> 
<li>With Mesa 5.0.2, a GLU sphere sets normal to (0,0,0), 
and needs glNormal3d (0.0, 0.0, 1.0) at draw_layer to correct 
the effect. Mesa 6.4.2, the last version, works fine.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug that crashed GAMGI after the
RCP report was produced: the press code didn't know about
the dialog change.</li>
<li>Thanks to Daniel Burka, from the 
<a href="http://labs.silverorange.com/">Silver Orange Laboratories</a>,
who created the initial version, we have now a web tabs-based 
template to show our Help documentation, available 
<a href="http://www.gamgi.org/lab/notebook/cell_create_symmetry.html">
here</a>.</li>
<li>A single function, in gamgi_gtk_dialog.c, is now used 
to create all reports in GAMGI, as in Voronoi tesselation,
RCP construction and point symmetry analysis.</li>
<li>The RCP building algorithm is now fully working, in the 
Cell->Link dialog. A report dialog shows the results. Input 
parameters were tested and are now safely controlled.</li>
<li>Removed a simple but nasty bug (thanks Pedro) that crashed GAMGI 
when pressing the screen with open System/Lattice/Group dialogs in 
Cell->Create, Cell->Modify.</li>
<li>Improved static_system, static_lattice, static_group,
in gamgi_gtk_cell_symmetry.c, in particular removed all fixed 
size settings. All dialogs in GAMGI are now size independent, 
so they should look fine with any font.</li>
<li>Removed font and slide bar settings from the xterm 
command launched by the Shell button.</li>
<li>Text->Create does not reset contents anymore, after 
creating Text objects. This is more user-friendly and is 
consistent with other object create dialogs, for example 
Cell->Create and Atom->create.</li>
<li>Removed size settings for: Vectors option menus in
Direction->Create and Plane->Create, Align buttons in
Cell->Create and Cell->Modify, List buttons in Cell->Create
and Cell->Modify.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in gamgi_mesa_axes.c: the
length of the axes was wrongly calculated. Improved
the code.</li>
<li>Cleaned font menu handling in gamgi_gtk_text_create.c, 
gamgi_gtk_text_modify.c and gamgi_gtk_text_config.c.</li>
<li>Changed the static_row function in gamgi_gtk_help_tutorial.c,
to avoid the bug in clist code reported below, although the bug
was never found in Help->Tutorial.</li>
<li>Removed size settings for: Vectors option menus in
Cell->Link, Align->Translation, Align->Rotation; Plane/Direction
option menus in Align->Translation, Align->Rotation; Planes
button in Cell->Measure. With larger fonts, these widgets were
clipping the text labels. Widget sizes should always be calculated
automatically, anyway. These problems still exist on Text->Create, 
Text->Modify and Window top menus.</li>
<li>Found and removed a nasty, old bug in gamgi_gtk_cell_symmetry, 
that crashed GAMGI (at least) when compiled with -O3, after pressing
a List button in Cell->Create or Cell->Modify dialogs.</li>
<li>Found and removed a minor, harmless bug in gamgi_mesa_text.c:
height was useless.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add Plane->Modify and Direction->Modify functionality.</li>
<li>Replace set/get_data functions by structures
defined in gtk/gamgi_object.h headers.</li>
<li>Add Object->Copy dialogs with basic copy functionality.</li>
<li>Add Contents and Container options in Object->Remove dialogs.</li>
<li>Implement dynamic text objects, to measure distances,
angles, etc. on real time.</li>
<li>Implement global selection, including global picking
algorithms and selection dialogs that include all the
selection methods.</li>

<div class="contents">

Epitaxial relations and all sort of complex Cell position 
and orientation relations with the current Layer and other 
Cells are now fully working, for all types of Cells.
Redesigned the object selection system, so now there is
a single entry point for ALL object selection in GAMGI.
The global object selection mechanism is now implemented.
Redesigned the Cell->Link dialog, and added functionality
to allow global Cell linking with other objects. Removed 
a couple of bugs in gtk code and math code.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Revised gamgi_math_measure.c, to correct origin and rotation issues.</li>
<li>Corrected Cell translation with a reference Layer, in gamgi_gtk_cell_align.c.
</li>
<li>Complex rotation and translation relations between multiple Cells 
and the current Layer are now working fine and can be easily established,
including all sorts of epitaxial relations. Polished gamgi_gtk_cell_align.c,
together with gamgi_gtk_cell_create.c and gamgi_gtk_cell_modify.c.</li>
<li>Found and removed a very simple but nasty bug (a typo), just 
introduced in the current version, resulting in wrong Cell->Link 
behaviour. Checked gamgi_gtk_cell_create.c and gamgi_gtk_cell_modify.c
for equivalent typos.</li>
<li>Improved gamgi_gtk_cell_position.c, so second level dialogs
in Cell->Create and Cell->Modify are now ready to handle
translation, rotation cell alignments.</li>
<li>Improved gamgi_gtk_cell_link.c, so Cell->Link is now ready 
to handle object, static and dynamic linking modes.</li>
<li>Simplified notation in gamgi_gtk_*.c files: item
instead of menu_item, menu instead of option_menu in 
get_data/set_data functions, button instead of toggle_button.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in the Cell translation code: 
the origin translation, after a change of origin, was wrong, 
when rotations were involved.</li>
<li>The mechanism to perform global object linking is working 
fine (tested in Cell->Link) and is simple and robust.</li>
<li>All functions are now working with the new selection functions.
Improved the gamgi_mesa_select.c layout.</li>
<li>Converted gamgi_gtk_modify* and gamgi_gtk_remove*

there is now a single function managing the whole procedure,
with a callback mechanism, making object selection code much
more elegant and easier to maintain and expand.</li>
<li>Gamgi is running on my IBM ThinkPad T43, with Ubuntu Breezy 5.10 
(with all library dependencies compiled by myself).</li>
<li>Redesigned the dialog Layer->Link, according to the 
new style. Started preparing global object links with this 
dialog.</li>
<li>Added two screenshots to www.gamgi.org.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in Cell->Modify: in three get_data 
calls the old name Origin was still used, instead of Translation, 
causing Gamgi to crash.</li>

Completed the reorganization of the Cell Link code, which
is now simpler and can handle any origin node (000) change, 
making the GAMGI patterns to link nodes even more useful.
These origin changes are now properly handled in reciprocal
lattice transformations and the plane (hkl) indexing in the 
reciprocal lattice is also ready to support them (the GUI code
is still lacking). New screenshots.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The plane indexing for all reciprocal lattices and
cell volumes, when the cell origin, node (000), is moved 
to any other arbitrary node (inside the cell or not), is 
completed and tested. This should be the last major task
to adapt all the GAMGI Cell code to work with arbitrary
node (000) positioning. What remains to be done is Gtk code.</li>
<li>Improved quaternion identification globally.</li>
<li>Improved the code handling cell origin and cell axes in 
gamgi_expat_import_object.c and gamgi_expat_export_object.c.</li>
<li>The Reciprocal Lattice transformation now handles gracefully
any change in cell origin, node (000), for all Cell lattices 
and volumes.</li>
<li>More gamgi_phys_cell_link.c cleaning.</li>
<li>Made a full backup for /home/gamgi/ at www_gamgi_org.</li>
<li>Added new screenshots, from Amelia Almeida PhD thesis, 
showing Al-based intermetallic compounds.</li>
<li>Cleaned again gamgi_phys_cell_link.c, which is now more 
powerful, more elegant and much simpler to maintain.</li>
<li>New Cell->Link is now working for Wigner-Seitz Cell volumes.</li>
<li>Updated the gamgi_phys_cell.c API, so same functions can also be used in 
gamgi_phys_cell_link.c code.</li>
<li>Added Debian Sid/Sarge default configuration to make_local, 
thanks to Carlos A. Neves, Instituto de Química da Universidade de São 
Paulo.</li>

Planes and Directions can now be represented outside the
Cell Volume. Removed a bug when drawing bonds. The cell
origin can now be changed to any node, even outside the Cell
volume. Cell axes can now be represented, with primitive
or conventional vectors. Cell->Link already works with 
arbitrary cell origins, for Primitive, Parallelepiped, Sphere,
Conventional Hexagonal Cell Volumes, allowing many more patterns
to fill Cells. Most indexing work to translate planes in
the reciprocal lattice, when the cell origin changes, is done.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Replaced static_parallelepiped_sphere_points and 
static_parallelepiped_sphere_index in gamgi_phys_cell_link
by common functions static_primitive_points and static_primitive_index,
valid also for conventional cases.</li>
<li>Removed the special (000) node position in Sphere and Parallelepiped 
Cell volumes. Code to create node coordinates and indexes is now
simpler, but the node (000) is not necessarily the first in the array.</li>
<li>Cell->Link is now working fine (including replication)
when the lattice is hP and the Volume is Conventional.</li>
<li>Cell->Link is now working fine (including replication) 
when the cell origin is moved, for Primitive volumes.</li>
<li>Cell->Link is now working fine when the cell origin 
is moved, for Sphere and Parallelepiped volumes.</li>
<li>Introduced functions gamgi_math_cell_orientation_get
and gamgi_math_cell_orientation_get, so now the interface
with a cell position/orientation is exclusively done 
through these 4 get/set (mentioned below) functions.</li>
<li>Separated gamgi_math_cell_position in
gamgi_math_cell_orientation_set and gamgi_math_cell_position_set,
so the interface with these functions is cleaner. These
functions shift the cell to the new origin node.</li>
<li>The cell (000) node origin can now be changed to
any other lattice, using conventional or primitive
vectors coordinates. The notation 000, 110, 101, 011,
111, 211, 122 is used to indicate inner nodes in
conventional cells.</li>
<li>Origin axes (conventional or primitive) can now be 
imported and exported to GAMGI XML files.</li>
<li>Developed (and tested) functions to convert nodes from
conventional to primitive coordinates and vice-versa.</li>
<li>Cell axes can now be represented in Conventional and
Primitive vectors. The new code is used also for Layer axes.
Both Cell and Layer axes are also drawn in scan mode.</li>
<li>Found and removed a serious old bug affecting vertical 
bonds and axes: the rotation axis could be (0,0,0).</li>
<li>Rewrote the code to built axes for layers and for cells.</li>
<li>When the reciprocal lattice is determined, the origin
should be always at (000) (users can change the origin after
that).</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in gamgi_phys_plane.c:
in gamgi_math_polygon_scan (), use cell_new->points instead 
of cell->points, as the two arrays might be different.</li>
<li>Found and removed a typo (but potentially harmful)
in gamgi_math_vector_translation: n3 instead of n2.</li>
<li>When the Cell origin changes, Planes and Directions 
are represented correctly now, in direct space.</li>
<li>When the Cell origin changes, properties measured from 
Planes in the reciprocal space are correctly calculated now.</li>
<li>Planes,Directions outside the Cell volume can now be created 
safely (the representation is built with the 3,2 points used 
to define the object.</li>
<li>When the Cell origin changes, the Planes in the reciprocal 
space are correctly identified now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

Rhombus and Sphere volumes.</li>
<li>Rewrote all the code covering Cell Parallelepiped and Sphere 
volumes. This is much simpler and easier to maintain than the
tricky code we had before. Moreover, now both Cell Parallelogram 
and Sphere volumes obey the standard orientation for conventional 
cells.</li>
<li>Found and removed a nasty bug, that went unnoticed for years:
points = cell->points was missing in functions handling centered
cells in gamgi_phys_cell_create.c. It worked because points was
defined just before, to the same address, and by "chance" it was 
still valid!</li>
<li>Started cleaning all the crystallographic code. Rhombus
and Sphere in reciprocal lattice are now fully working with 
the new code.</li>
<li>Polygon functions are now reunited in the file 
gamgi_math_polygon.c, which helps cleaning the Cell code.</li>
<li>Cell rhombus volumes are now built with the same orientation
as the other cell volumes, with the conventional vectors along
the main axes.</li>
<li>Uncoupled the code to find nodes inside a sphere and to get 
the node range to search, used somewhere else. Fixed this code.</li>
<li>Crystallographic directions can now be seen as segments, 
for all volumes and types of cells.</li>
<li>Found and removed a bug in gamgi_phys_plane.c: in spherical
volumes, horizontal planes as (001) produced bogus rotation matrices.
