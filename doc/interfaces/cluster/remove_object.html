<h1>Cluster Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">
<ul>
<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove a cluster (or list of clusters, previously         
selected with Cluster->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the cluster and all 
its contents is removed. This is the default.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Container</b>, the cluster is removed but
its contents (child clusters, molecules, groups, planes, directions, 
atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) is saved, linked to the cluster parent.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the cluster is preserved but 
all its contents (child clusters, molecules, groups, planes, directions, 
atoms, bonds, orbitals, texts) is removed. 

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>cluster</b>, <b>molecule</b>, <b>group</b>, 
<b>plane</b>, <b>direction</b>, <b>atom</b>, <b>bond</b>, <b>orbital</b>
or <b>text</b>, these objects are removed from the cluster.

<p/>

When the removed cluster was part of the current object,
the current layer becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over a cluster in the current layer, its identification
is transported to the dialog and <b>Ok</b> is automatically pressed.
To recover the previous state press <b>Undo</b>.
