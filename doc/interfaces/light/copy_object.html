Indicate here the number of light copies to create and its destination.

<p/>

Gamgi expects users to identify first the light or list of lights to copy.
When the <b>Light</b> entry is active and empty, clicking the mouse over
the window graphic area creates a menu with all the layer lights (local
selection), which can then be selected and the identification transported
to the <b>Light</b> entry. Pressing the <b>List</b> button, the current
list of lights is selected instead.

<h3>Name</h3>

This is the name given to the new light copies. The
default is to copy the name of each original light.

<h3>Number</h3>

This is the requested number of copies, a positive integer.
The default is 1.

<h3>Layer</h3>

After identifying the light or list of lights to copy, GAMGI expects
users to identify a layer to where the lights should be copied. Pressing
the mouse over the graphic area in any window (global selection), creates
a menu with all the layers in that window, which can then be selected.
The current layer is initially proposed in the <b>Layer</b> entry.

<p/>

When copying a list of lights, the copies can also be created at the
layer of each original light, by setting <b>Layer</b> to <b>Local</b>.
