<div>GAMGI 0.08</div><div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Finished and tested gtk_light_modify. This 
completes the create, modify and remove mechanisms 
for atoms, bonds, cells, lights, and layers, plus
create, remove mechanims for windows and remove 
mechanims for molecules. gtk_select mechanisms
are partly implemented for all GAMGI objects but 
need to be rewritten and extended  after GTK2.0
comes out.

Cleaning and documentation.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Makefiles cleaned: files are not included in subsets
anymore and are just listed in alphabetic order instead.
Files on each directory are thus compiled in the same 
order as they appear when listed with the ls command.</li>
<li>Added documentation to phys_cell.c.</li>
<li>gtk_layer_remove updated, so layers can be selected
and removed with a pop up menu, just like lights.</li>

gtk_gamgi_exit, gtk_window_create and main_convert files.</li>
<li>Corrected a mistake on atom_modify.c</li>
<li>Removed a memory leak: GtkStyles were copied but not removed,
gtk_style_unref (style) to the rescue.</li>
<li>Just started gtk_layer_modify.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Finish light_modify.c.</li>
<li>Implement layer_modify.c.</li>

Lots of improvments on WS cells.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hexagonal P WS cells is included in Orthorhombic C WS cells,
so there are only Orthorhombic WS cells now: Hexagonal,
Cubic and Tetragonal are particular cases. WS cells for 
Romboedric, Monoclinic and Triclinic systems are not handled 
currently.</li>
<li>The general architecture to handle faces and lines in WS 
cells was considerably improved, so now all cases are handled 
by a single function: loops_8, loops_12, loops_14 and lines_18.</li>
<li>Filtering faces and lines for Faces and Edges modes in
Orthorhombic I and Orthorhombic F WS cells is completed,
for all possible orientations (permutations).</li>

General cleaning on group operations;
Start adding code for light modify.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>work on gamgi_gtk_light_modify just started, the dialog
is already in place but most of the callbacks are not.</li>
<li>GAMGI_VERTICES enumeration and static_vertices routines
changed to GAMGI_EDGES and static_edges, respectively. The
name is better and shorter, solving a GUI little problem 
with lack of space in gamgi_gtk_cell_modify.</li>
<li>gamgi_gtk_group_measure and gamgi_gtk_group_modify were totally 
cleaned. In particular, undo works with gamgi_gtk_group_modify.</li>

<div class="contents">

More work on WS cells.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The problem of ordering the lattice parameters
is definitely solved. Basically the length parameters are
sorted (and the angle parameters are swaped) and a matrix
keeps record of the whole transformation. Global sorting
is decomposed in pair sortings, that can be described by
rotations. The final resulting matrix is inverted so the 
vertices can be allocated in the standard orientation and 
then transformed back multiplying by that inverse matrix. 
This works with all lattices, including trigonal, monoclinic, 
and triclinic, where angles are not necessarily 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Code was added to determine the determinant, adjunct, 
transpose and inverse of 3x3 matrices.</li>
<li>matrix_absolute, matrix_relative, vector_absolute, 
vector_relative, replace and expand matrix_set, vector_set.</li>
<li>Code was added to reduce number of points 
in Vertices mode in Hexagonal_P and Orthorhombic_C WS cells.</li>
<li>A math file containing sort routines, including sort2
and sort3 for doubles and longs, was added and used
in chem_bond.c and phys_cell.c.</li>
<li>Code was added to handle the case where the user
requested a WS cell not done yet: Rhomboedric_P, Monoclinic_P,
Monoclinic_B, Orthorhombic_I, Triclinic_P.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Handle Faces and Vertices modes in most WS cells,
by filtering faces, loops and lines.</li>
<li>Add code to handle the three Orthorhombic I WS cells.</li>
<li>The faces description in WS cells with the same faces
topology should be handled by a single, common, function.</li>
<li>Handle translation and rotation operations ordered
by the user in the dialog box.</li>

<div>GAMGI 0.07.20</div><div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Code to handle WS cell objects was improved.

<h3>What is new:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A function was added to remove unused points, loops and lines in 
WS cells. This function is required to clean the arrays, in Faces 
and Vertices modes (where inner points, faces and lines are not 
considered).</li>
<li>Orthorhombic F WS cells are now implemented.</li>
<li>Code to handle Hexagonal P and Orthorhombic C WS cells was
partially rewritten, because in the Faces mode, the faces
must use the loops array while the frame must use
the lines array.</li>
<li>The wired loops test was slightly changed to handle 
these two new cases, which never use the loops array.</li>
<li>Code was added to initialise loops and lines arrays,
in WS cells that require the cleaning function mentioned
above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is next:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Everything is now ready for the final assault
to handle Faces and Vertices modes for most WS cells.</li>
<li>Add code to handle the three Orthorhombic I WS cells.</li>
<li>The faces description in WS cells with the same faces
topology should be handled by a single, common, function.</li>
<li>Add sort2 and sort3 functions to handle tetragonal
and orthorhombic parameters in a simple, systematic way.</li>
<li>When the parameter order is changed, rotate cells
in the end, so they appear with the expected orientation.</li>
<li>Add message for WS cells which will be written later:
Rhomboedric, Monoclinic and Triclinic.</li>
<li>Handle translation and rotation operations ordered
by the user in the dialog box.</li>
</ul>
