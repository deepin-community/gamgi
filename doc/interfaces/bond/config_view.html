Define here the visual style applied by default to new bonds. 

<h3>Style</h3>

This menu controls which style is applied by default when creating a new 
bond: a cylinder in <b>solid</b> mode or a line in <b>wired</b> mode.

<p/>

Cylinders provide a better visual quality, when coupled with lights, 
but demand more screen space and processing time. 

Lines become poorly visible when using lights, unless the ambient component 
is significant, as diffuse and specular lights are not reflected.

<h3>Size</h3>

This parameter controls the size applied by default when creating
bonds in <b>Solid</b> mode. Combining bond <b>Size</b> with atom 
<b>Variancy</b> and <b>Size</b>, it is possible to obtain a wide 
range of styles to represent atomic structures.

<p/>

The default is to represent atoms (<b>Size</b> = <b>0.8</b>) slightly 
larger than bonds (<b>Size</b> = <b>0.5</b>). An elegant style is to 
represent bonds with the same <b>Size</b> as atoms (<b>0.5</b>).

<p/>

To guarantee that bond cylinders are closed by atom spheres,
bond <b>Size</b> should not be larger than atom <b>Size</b>.

<h3>Color</h3>

This button controls whether by default the bond is represented 
with its own, independent color, or inherits the colors of the parent atoms.

<h3>R, G, B</h3>

These entries set the color used by default, between black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) 
and white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), when bonds are rendered with their own independent 
color.
