<h1>Layer Remove</h1>

<div id="notebook">
<ul>
<li><span>Object</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="contents">

Indicate how to remove a layer (or list of layers, previously         
selected with Layer->Select, when <b>Global</b> is pressed).

<h3>Scope</h3>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>All</b>, the layer and all its contents 
is removed. This is the default. When the removed layer was the 
current layer, the layer before or the layer after becomes the new 
current layer. When the removed layer is the last one, a new layer 
is automatically created and made the current layer.


<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>Contents</b>, the layer is preserved but 
all its contents (lights, assemblies, graphs, shapes, arrows, cells, 
clusters, molecules, groups, planes, directions, atoms, bonds, orbitals, 
texts) is removed.

<p/>

When the <b>Scope</b> is <b>light</b>, <b>assembly</b>, <b>graph</b>, 
<b>shape</b>, <b>arrow</b>, <b>cell</b>, <b>cluster</b>, <b>molecule</b>, 
<b>group</b>, <b>plane</b>, <b>direction</b>, <b>atom</b>, <b>bond</b>, 
<b>orbital</b> or <b>text</b>, these objects are removed from the layer. 

<p/>

When the target layer is the current layer, the final current layer 
becomes the new current object.

<p/>

Clicking the mouse over the graphic area in the current window 
creates a menu with all the layers in the window, which can then 
be selected. Initially, the identification of the current layer 
is inserted in the <b>Layer</b> entry. This task cannot be reversed, 
so pressing <b>Ok</b> is required.
