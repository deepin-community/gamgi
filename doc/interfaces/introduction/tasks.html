Every object in GAMGI can be created, selected, copied, linked, modified and removed. Several objects can be measured: Graph, Cell, Cluster, Molecule, Group, Plane and Direction. A few objects can be animated: Cell, Cluster and Molecule.

<h3>Create</h3>

These tasks are used to create new objects in GAMGI, usually one each time, though multiple bonds can be created simultaneously. These tasks allow users to specify all the properties available for each type of object. These properties can be later modified by calling the respective <b>Modify</b> task. In some circunstances, <b>Copy</b> and <b>Link</b> tasks can also create objects, but these are just clones of objects that exist already.

<h3>Select</h3>

These tasks are used to select a single object or a list of objects, choosen according to its properties, tree hierarchy, or scope. A list of selected objects is very useful because it can be used in other tasks as Copy, Modify and Remove, to copy, modify or remove a whole list of objects at once. The list currently selected can be used as the sampling scope for the next selection, so multiple selections can be sucessively applied, this way filtering down the list until reaching the desired object set.

<h3>Copy</h3>

<h3>Link</h3>

<h3>Modify</h3>

These tasks are used to modify a single object or a list of objects, previously selected with the Select task. Single objects can be selected just clicking over its visual representation. For objects that have no visual representation, as light, layer and window, a pop up menu will appear when clicking on the screen, allowing users to select just one object. For recursive objects, as text, group, cluster and assembly, where multiple choices are possible for the same visual representation, a pop up menu will appear when clicking on the screen, allowing users to select just one object. After selecting a single object with the mouse, its properties will appear in the Modify task window. When executing a task, empty entries and <b>Local</b> menus will remain unchanged, the others are modified.

<h3>Measure</h3>

<h3>Animate</h3>

<h3>Remove</h3>

These tasks are used to remove a single object or a list of objects, previously selected with the <b>Select</b> task. Single objects can be removed just clicking over its visual representation. For objects that have no visual representation, as light, layer and window, a pop up menu will appear when clicking on the screen, allowing users to select just one object, that is immediately removed. For recursive objects, as text, group, cluster and assembly, a pop up menu will appear when clicking on the screen, if multiple choices are possible for the same visual representation, allowing users to select just one object. Users can choose to remove the object itself (the container), its child (the contents) or both.
